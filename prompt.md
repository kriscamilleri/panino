I just migrated this backend from pouchdb+couchdb to powersync+sqlite+postgres. It was a pretty major refactoring. Now I'm still encountering errors - slowly but surely we must resolve them. My current issue is that When I create a file it does not appear in the sidebar, the editor, or in the preview. In th editor and the preview I see the text No file selected.

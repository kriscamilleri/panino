I just migrated this backend from pouchdb+couchdb to powersync+sqlite+postgres. It was a pretty major refactoring. Now I'm still encountering errors - slowly but surely we must resolve them. My current error is:

Initialization Failed
We couldn't set up the local database. This might be due to an unsupported browser or a critical error.

Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'execute')

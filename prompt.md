We are building a note taking app. We're mid abandoned migration to a Sqlite+Powersync+Postgres implementation from a pouchdb+couchdb implementation. We're now reevaluating how to reduce complexity and fix existing issues given we have a proper relational db at our disposal now. We're using crsqlite to do this. Before we press on - is there any code which isn't being used or we can remove given we now have sqlite in the frontend, and no pouch/couch/powersync anywhere?

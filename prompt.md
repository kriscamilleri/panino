We are building a note taking app. We're mid abandoned migration to a Sqlite+Powersync+Postgres implementation from a pouchdb+couchdb implementation. We're now reevaluating how to reduce complexity and fix existing issues given we have a proper relational db at our disposal now. We're using crsqlite to do this. I am getting the sync poll - but no notes or folders are actually being synced it seems. The tables for notes and folders on the sqlite database on the server are empty - they seem to be saving them correctly on the frontend (I verified using await docStore.syncStore.execute('SELECT * FROM notes;')).

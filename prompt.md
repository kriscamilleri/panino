Let's continue our work on the markdown rendering in our Print outs. The full stops and commas are strangely aligned. When I use different fonts it clips on existing letters, with Roboto there is too much space. It doesn't seem to affect letters and numbers or most special characters. 

Please output the entirety of any new or modified files.

If for example I set this to W, then I am looking at a block of example 40 hours (Monday to Sunday), If I set D I am looking for a block of 8 hours from 0000 to 2359. Highly used in were shifts are not linear, say morning is 8 hours, evening is 6 hours and night is 10 hours, you would be looking at a W to be able to block these. \n- What is Reservation?\n> 2.\tThe Calc is used to create blocks of hours calculation (D/W/M). If for example I set this to W, then I am looking at a block of example 40 hours (Monday to Sunday), If I set D I am looking for a block of 8 hours from 0000 to 2359. Highly used in were shifts are not linear, say morning is 8 hours, evening is 6 hours and night is 10 hours, you would be looking at a W to be able to block these. \n\n### Slide 30\n- What kind of validation is required here?\n\t- Ex. do we check if the value of Hours per Day match with input values?\nNo valuation is required, the entries rely completely on the knowledge of the consultant / user operating this screen\n\n- The example in the powerpoint displays a table. Am I interpreting the column titles correctly? (the ones in bold I was unable to decipher  what they meant)\n\t- RosterId\n\t- ShiftRosterPattern\n\t- Time In\n\t- Time Out\n\t- **ROSDTSWT?**\n\t- **ROSCALC?**\n\t- Roster Pattern\n\t- **ROSTRSN?**\n\n> a.\tROSDTSWT = the roster goes beyond midnight and switches to next day\nb.\tROSCALC = Calculate the hours in this roster entry, do not calculate the hours in the roster entry. If I have a roster Day, Evening, Night, rest,  Off : then when I am rest and off there should be no calculation as there should be no hours clocked. So any hours clocked would be outside the roster and so raise an exception which would be interpreted by the rule. \nc.\tROSTRSN = Allow the roster pattern to be transferrable or not. A person assigned to a roster patterns can transfer his pattern to another person, say one if day one is evening, and they exchange, the system will consider this during valuation\n\n\n### Slide 31\n- Are all these fields drop downs? If not (aside from Sequence), which are freetext/other data types?\n> Header YES, Group = yes, Sequence = No (automatic increment by 1), Exception YES, Message = No, Smart = No, Logic = Yes, Val2 = NO, Event = Yes, Operator = Yes, Employee  = YES\n\n### Slide 32\n- What happens to public holidays? Is this irrelevant in this screen?\n> The period Scheduler is not concerned with Holidays, those are brought into the scene when the valuation is being done from the company calendar\n- Are hours calculated automatically, or manually input?\n> Hours are input manually\n\n### Slide 33\n- Can an employee have multiple positions? If so, do we list all of them? Or do we have position as a multi-select of its own?\n> An employee can have multiple position, but we only show the one default he has. \n\n### Slide 36\n- What is 'import Job file from device'?\n> The import job from device, is the actual import of raw clocking from the device (hardware) or (hardware central system)\n\n- When creating a new job, is there any validation that needs to be done on the frontend? (Ex. Same ShiftID, overlapping From & To)\n>  When you create a job, you effectively are creating a new import from the device. And then depending on the import you then proceed to do a time valuation. NO validation\n\n- Do we need to reuse an existing Wizard UI component for this, or can we implement it ourselves?\n> No idea\n \n### Slide 37\n- Is this after right clicking and selecting 'Import Job from File' or from double clicking on a row of a job?\n> When you create a job, you effectively are creating a new import from the device. And then depending on the import you then proceed to do a time valuation. NO validation\n- What is the purpose of this upload?\n> So a job is made up of raw clockings which are then passed through the  and the valuation of those raw clockings. \n\n### Slide 38\n- Are edits of the table displayed in a modal, or redirect to a new page?\n>\tThis is not editing this is creating a new job. \n\n### Slide 40\n- What is a profile?\n> \tProfile Slide 15: used for jobs\n- Do we only show the group, shift and schema information present in the previous slide or do we display additional information?\n>   If the user selected a job, then this displays the contents of that job.\n- Is locked editable?\n> Locked is editable by the job owner\n### Slide 42\n- What data needs to be submitted?\n> 1.  No data is needed, This is a confirmation screen to post the job as such the user needs to unlock the job then post. Once posted the job disappears from the ledger.\n\n### Slide 44\n- What is the tree on the left? Is it:\n\tShift Group > Shift > Pattern > Employee\n>\t-   Correct, it is the shift / Roster / Employees assigned to the roster\n\n- Is this page for overriding errors or warnings encountered in the Job?\n> No it is not to override errors, it is a dynamic screen to get approvals of timesheets. For Error handling and exceptions please see slide 41, where we are providing the colour coded warnings and errors of the valuation\n\n- Is the override meant to supersede the  approver's input?\n>  Yes it is meant to over ride the approver\n\n### Slide 45/46\n- How is this different from 44? \n> 1.\tNotice the filter at the top of the page in slide 44 it is <<DAY>> in 46 it is <<MY approvals>> so here we are looking from the perspective of someone who approves \n\n- Is this equivalent of what Marco Juliani in previous slide would see?\n>  Yes so in the previous it’s the time valuator screen, in the 46 it is the approver screen\n\n### Slide 48\n- This seems to be for review only. What does the button do?\n> Correct\n\n### Slide 50\n- What do the buttons do?\n>\tThis is to reset jobs. \n\n### Slide 51\n- The second table seems to have no relationship with the above table (ex different JobIds, schema, etc...). Is this a summary of the job warnings and errors encountered before? Or is it unrelated?\n> While the screen is just a mock, the tables are related, as we want to provide the details of the actual job in order to reset. \n\n- If the job is reset, what happens to the approvals?\n> 2.\tGood question, these would be brought back to editable state\n\n### Slide 52\n- Can a reset job have statistics?\n> Yes\n\n### Slide 53/54\n- Is the right click > Job Statistics Breakdown related to the nested table? Or is it a summary of the nested table?\n> Both, it is aggregating the values depending on the column filtered\n\n### Slide 56\n- Is this Employee Master unrelated to the main Employee Master? \n> Same different view (only showing T&A relevant tabs)\n- Are these time-smarts different from the regular smarts in Employee Master?\n> Same different view\n- Do we need to select which employee via card UI prior to seeing this screen?\n> Yes sure, in order to enter into the tab you would have already selected the employee \n\n### Slide 57\n- What does 'time management can be assigned to the employee' mean? Does this mean the UI seen on this slide is hidden behind a toggle?\n>  An employee can be assigned to T&A or Not, if he is assigned to T&A then he would be part of a shift. \n- What are the fields 001 and date range refer to?\n> An employee can be assigned to T&A or Not, if he is assigned to T&A then he would be part of a shift. \n- Can the values here be edited? Or is this view only?\n> No the values are inherited from the Shift Master Library, once you assign the shift, the employee inherits the details of the shift and the roster pattern. What can be done is the employee starts the shift at a specific date (range at top) \n\n### Slide 58 - 60\n- Is this related to a single employee?\n>\tNote the horizontal arrow placement. In 58 it is on the pattern, therefore showing the pattern Morning, and in 60 its on the pattern evening\n\n- What is VL? Vacation Leave? What is IST?\n>\tVL is vacation leave and IST is a typo mistake, if Peter is on VL it shows the Absence type VL1\n- When does this user icon show?\n> The user Icon can be visible always, as long as when you go over it or click on it, it displays the people and their status (Presence / absence)\n- Where do we select the user? Are we seeing all users on this calendar view? \n>  Yes because the horizontal arrow is on the Pattern and not on the employee as in slide 61 where the horizontal arrow is on John Cassar \n- Does this refer to a specific month? Or is this generic?\n> At the top of the slide you have filters <<MONTH>>, this means that the calendar view is for a month. We should have navigation buttons for the calendar control, in slide 61 the calendar control is <<WEEK>>\n\n### Slide 61\n- How this alternate absence view toggled? Do we present a drop down at the top (including in previous slides)? \n> Filters on the top and the horizontal arrow in the tree \n\n### Slide 62 - 69\n- I did not understand these slides at all. \n> 1.\tWe explained that the tree on the left and the filters at top display different views and details of a shift, pattern and assignment. By switching from Month to wee to Day one can navigate in detail and therefore support shift planning. \na.\tSlide 62 filter by employee calendar set to week view display roster\nb.\tSlide 63 filter by employee calendar set to week view display absence\nc.\tSlide 64 filter by employee calendar set to month view display roster\nd.\tSo we communicated that once a shift is setup with a roster this cannot be changed. However, A shift roster assigned to a person can be changed slide 63. So if say John is Working Monday a Morning shift but we want him to work an evening shift instead we are able to replace the pattern entry for that specific Monday for John. If you have done such an amendment, Paul would need to be notified, and so the publish roster is this notification. \ne.\tINFORMATION MENU OPTION = the information menu option can be used by the T&A operator to generate, view, publish  and print rosters (slide 65,66,67,68,69) for either one or more employees. The print menu is providing the following filers and formats. \n \n",

Or is it a summary of the nested table?\n> Both, it is aggregating the values depending on the column filtered\n\n### Slide 56\n- Is this Employee Master unrelated to the main Employee Master? \n> Same different view (only showing T&A relevant tabs)\n- Are these time-smarts different from the regular smarts in Employee Master?\n> Same different view\n- Do we need to select which employee via card UI prior to seeing this screen?\n> Yes sure, in order to enter into the tab you would have already selected the employee \n\n### Slide 57\n- What does 'time management can be assigned to the employee' mean? Does this mean the UI seen on this slide is hidden behind a toggle?\n>  An employee can be assigned to T&A or Not, if he is assigned to T&A then he would be part of a shift. \n- What are the fields 001 and date range refer to?\n> An employee can be assigned to T&A or Not, if he is assigned to T&A then he would be part of a shift. \n- Can the values here be edited? Or is this view only?\n> No the values are inherited from the Shift Master Library, once you assign the shift, the employee inherits the details of the shift and the roster pattern. What can be done is the employee starts the shift at a specific date (range at top) \n\n### Slide 58 - 60\n- Is this related to a single employee?\n>\tNote the horizontal arrow placement. In 58 it is on the pattern, therefore showing the pattern Morning, and in 60 its on the pattern evening\n\n- What is VL? Vacation Leave? What is IST?\n>\tVL is vacation leave and IST is a typo mistake, if Peter is on VL it shows the Absence type VL1\n- When does this user icon show?\n> The user Icon can be visible always, as long as when you go over it or click on it, it displays the people and their status (Presence / absence)\n- Where do we select the user? Are we seeing all users on this calendar view? \n>  Yes because the horizontal arrow is on the Pattern and not on the employee as in slide 61 where the horizontal arrow is on John Cassar \n- Does this refer to a specific month? Or is this generic?\n> At the top of the slide you have filters <<MONTH>>, this means that the calendar view is for a month. We should have navigation buttons for the calendar control, in slide 61 the calendar control is <<WEEK>>\n\n### Slide 61\n- How this alternate absence view toggled? Do we present a drop down at the top (including in previous slides)? \n> Filters on the top and the horizontal arrow in the tree \n\n### Slide 62 - 69\n- I did not understand these slides at all. \n> 1.\tWe explained that the tree on the left and the filters at top display different views and details of a shift, pattern and assignment. By switching from Month to wee to Day one can navigate in detail and therefore support shift planning. \na.\tSlide 62 filter by employee calendar set to week view display roster\nb.\tSlide 63 filter by employee calendar set to week view display absence\nc.\tSlide 64 filter by employee calendar set to month view display roster\nd.\tSo we communicated that once a shift is setup with a roster this cannot be changed. However, A shift roster assigned to a person can be changed slide 63. So if say John is Working Monday a Morning shift but we want him to work an evening shift instead we are able to replace the pattern entry for that specific Monday for John. If you have done such an amendment, Paul would need to be notified, and so the publish roster is this notification. \ne.\tINFORMATION MENU OPTION = the information menu option can be used by the T&A operator to generate, view, publish  and print rosters (slide 65,66,67,68,69) for either one or more employees. The print menu is providing the following filers and formats. \n \n",

We are then going to secure that endpoint using an external identity provider that will guarantee the identity of the user.\n\nIt's just a few steps from being a massive SaaS.\n\n## Important warning: YMMV\n\nThis Quickstart assumes you are running **Windows 11**. The instructions and tooling will vary on other platforms (you may want to consider [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on MacOS and *nix) but the overall flow and instructions will stay the same.\n\n## The toolkit\n\n#### Docker or Docker desktop\n\nWe will use Docker to compose an image of a KeyCloak server, thus avoiding the need to set one up, which would require three quickstarts alone.\n\n#### KeyCloak docker image\n\nWe will use this dockerfile to run a server with a KeyCloak instance that will hold the information about our user and provide identity validation.\n\n#### Visual Studio 2022 and the default Minimal API template\n\nThis is the default project template you will find ready and waiting in VS2022 - it provides just the right amount of simplicity and endpoints.\n\n#### A local database - Postgres\n\nWe will need to have a local database to store, mostly, KeyCloak's information which is not persisted when the container goes down. Postgres is the one that will be used in this Quickstart.\n\n#### KeyCloak Provider Nuget\n\nThis will help us with REST requests to KeyCloak and provide ready-made classes to make sense of the responses.\n\n## The process\n\n### 1) Get Docker\n\nDocker pushes for the usage of Docker Desktop as of this writing, although using the tried and true Docker engine and `docker compose up` will yield exactly the same results.\n\nYou can get Docker Desktop on the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).\n\nOn Windows, if during installation you get asked for **admin credentials**, then likely you won't be able to properly run Docker Desktop until you add your user to the `docker-users` group using Computer Management.\n\n![Refer to any online tutorial for details](https://inspectraeu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ilya_prettyneat_io/Documents/_temp_pub_res/computer-management.png) _Refer to any online guide for more details_\n\n  \n\n### 2) Run a container with KeyCloak and a database in it\n\n  \n\nOnce you manage to properly run Docker Desktop, it will ask you if you wish to maybe, perhaps, run a **PostgreSQL** example -- don't (it actually complicates network handling).\n\nRather, create a comfortable folder for a `YAML` file with the name `docker-compose.yml` and the following content:\n\n```yaml\n\nversion: '3'\n\n  \n\nvolumes:\n\npostgres_data:\n\ndriver: local\n\n  \n\nservices:\n\npostgres:\n\nimage: postgres\n\nvolumes:\n\n- postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\nenvironment:\n\nPOSTGRES_DB: keycloak\n\nPOSTGRES_USER: keycloak\n\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD: REPLACEME\n\n  \n\nkeycloak:\n\nimage: bitnami/keycloak:latest\n\nenvironment:\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_HOST: localhost\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_NAME: keycloak\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_USER: keycloak\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: REPLACEME\n\nKEYCLOAK_ADMIN: admin\n\nKEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD: REPLACEMETOO\n\n  \n\nports:\n\n- 8080:8080\n\ndepends_on:\n\n- postgres\n\n```\n\n_YAML has significant whitespace, so be careful or check out the git repo_\n\n  \n\n>  **A word of caution**\n\n> The passwords above are, obviously, not production safe\n\n  \n\nIf you are following from the **git repo** then it's already in `/kc-docker/docker-compose.yml` -- go to your `yml` file and run the magic command (from **Powershell**):\n\n  \n\n`docker compose up -d`\n\n  \n\nAt which point your KeyCloak container should get latest, download, have you wait a significant amount of time (depending on your network) and finally start running, which you should also see reflected in Docker Desktop:\n\n![Containers running](https://inspectraeu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ilya_prettyneat_io/Documents/_temp_pub_res/running-container.png)\n\n_If you experience excess of white, check the theme_\n\n  \n\nAt this point, we may want to visit our instance and see what's going on.\n\n  \n\n### 3) Configure KeyCloak\n\nUsing your browser of choice, navigate to [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/) -- you can see (and configure) the port in Docker.\n\nThen press `Administration Console` and enter the credentials when prompted (they are hardcoded in the YAML file, for the moment):\n\n```\n\nUsername: admin\n\nPassword: REPLACEMETOO\n\n```\n\nOnce greeted by the admin panel, we shall start by creating a **Realm**, the topmost \"container\" in KeyCloak that can be configured with its own rules, clients, users, providers and so on.\n\n![KeyCloak - Create Realm button](https://inspectraeu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ilya_prettyneat_io/Documents/_temp_pub_res/create-realm.png)\n\n  \n\n**Very important: pick a URI-valid name**\n\nThe name should be a simple word or a slug, anything that would not break even the simplest of URI, as the name of the Realm will become part of all of the authentication paths going forward.\n\n**for this tutorial we will name our realm `test`**\n\n  \n\nFirst thing to do is check out the **Clients** (menu on the left):\n\n  \n\n- Among the pre-configured clients there is `account`. Open the client, Scroll down to the \"Access settings\" section and switch on **Client Authentication**. Next, check \"Service account roles\". This allows the \"account\" client to use its own secret to authenticate itself. Save (bottom of the page).\n\n- Navigate to the \"Credentials\" tab and set the authenticator to \"Client Id and Secret\", thus allowing this Client to authenticate with the equivalent of a secret key. Regenerate the key (if the button is greyed out, reload) and take note of it.\n\n- Finally, back to the \"Settings\", we need to add a valid URI where our OIDC path will be redirect. Add `http://localhost:8085/*` and `http://localhost:5000/*` as valid URIs (default URIs for Vue3, .NET, with a wildcard).\n\n- Now, back to the list of clients, open `realm-management` and re-generate the Secret Key like before (take note of it). Check in the \"Roles\" tab that the list of roles is not empty\n\n  \n\nYou may now proceed to create the first of the **Users** in the eponymous tab:\n\n  \n\n- When creating the user make sure to tick the \"email verified\" switch -- it increases the convenience for testing purposes\n\n- You will not see a \"Password\" field and this is normal -- users in KeyCloak may possess zero to many different credentials, which may or may not be passwords.\n\n- Once the user is created, in the \"Credentials\" tab you will be able to set a password. Set a simple one (you are _guaranteed_ to mis-type it at least once) and mark it as **not** temporary\n\n  \n\nThis is enough configuration on this side. Time to create something to authenticate.\n",

Postgres is the one that will be used in this Quickstart.\n\n#### KeyCloak Provider Nuget\n\nThis will help us with REST requests to KeyCloak and provide ready-made classes to make sense of the responses.\n\n## The process\n\n### 1) Get Docker\n\nDocker pushes for the usage of Docker Desktop as of this writing, although using the tried and true Docker engine and `docker compose up` will yield exactly the same results.\n\nYou can get Docker Desktop on the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).\n\nOn Windows, if during installation you get asked for **admin credentials**, then likely you won't be able to properly run Docker Desktop until you add your user to the `docker-users` group using Computer Management.\n\n![Refer to any online tutorial for details](https://inspectraeu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ilya_prettyneat_io/Documents/_temp_pub_res/computer-management.png) _Refer to any online guide for more details_\n\n  \n\n### 2) Run a container with KeyCloak and a database in it\n\n  \n\nOnce you manage to properly run Docker Desktop, it will ask you if you wish to maybe, perhaps, run a **PostgreSQL** example -- don't (it actually complicates network handling).\n\nRather, create a comfortable folder for a `YAML` file with the name `docker-compose.yml` and the following content:\n\n```yaml\n\nversion: '3'\n\n  \n\nvolumes:\n\npostgres_data:\n\ndriver: local\n\n  \n\nservices:\n\npostgres:\n\nimage: postgres\n\nvolumes:\n\n- postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\nenvironment:\n\nPOSTGRES_DB: keycloak\n\nPOSTGRES_USER: keycloak\n\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD: REPLACEME\n\n  \n\nkeycloak:\n\nimage: bitnami/keycloak:latest\n\nenvironment:\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_HOST: localhost\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_NAME: keycloak\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_USER: keycloak\n\nKEYCLOAK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: REPLACEME\n\nKEYCLOAK_ADMIN: admin\n\nKEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD: REPLACEMETOO\n\n  \n\nports:\n\n- 8080:8080\n\ndepends_on:\n\n- postgres\n\n```\n\n_YAML has significant whitespace, so be careful or check out the git repo_\n\n  \n\n>  **A word of caution**\n\n> The passwords above are, obviously, not production safe\n\n  \n\nIf you are following from the **git repo** then it's already in `/kc-docker/docker-compose.yml` -- go to your `yml` file and run the magic command (from **Powershell**):\n\n  \n\n`docker compose up -d`\n\n  \n\nAt which point your KeyCloak container should get latest, download, have you wait a significant amount of time (depending on your network) and finally start running, which you should also see reflected in Docker Desktop:\n\n![Containers running](https://inspectraeu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ilya_prettyneat_io/Documents/_temp_pub_res/running-container.png)\n\n_If you experience excess of white, check the theme_\n\n  \n\nAt this point, we may want to visit our instance and see what's going on.\n\n  \n\n### 3) Configure KeyCloak\n\nUsing your browser of choice, navigate to [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/) -- you can see (and configure) the port in Docker.\n\nThen press `Administration Console` and enter the credentials when prompted (they are hardcoded in the YAML file, for the moment):\n\n```\n\nUsername: admin\n\nPassword: REPLACEMETOO\n\n```\n\nOnce greeted by the admin panel, we shall start by creating a **Realm**, the topmost \"container\" in KeyCloak that can be configured with its own rules, clients, users, providers and so on.\n\n![KeyCloak - Create Realm button](https://inspectraeu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ilya_prettyneat_io/Documents/_temp_pub_res/create-realm.png)\n\n  \n\n**Very important: pick a URI-valid name**\n\nThe name should be a simple word or a slug, anything that would not break even the simplest of URI, as the name of the Realm will become part of all of the authentication paths going forward.\n\n**for this tutorial we will name our realm `test`**\n\n  \n\nFirst thing to do is check out the **Clients** (menu on the left):\n\n  \n\n- Among the pre-configured clients there is `account`. Open the client, Scroll down to the \"Access settings\" section and switch on **Client Authentication**. Next, check \"Service account roles\". This allows the \"account\" client to use its own secret to authenticate itself. Save (bottom of the page).\n\n- Navigate to the \"Credentials\" tab and set the authenticator to \"Client Id and Secret\", thus allowing this Client to authenticate with the equivalent of a secret key. Regenerate the key (if the button is greyed out, reload) and take note of it.\n\n- Finally, back to the \"Settings\", we need to add a valid URI where our OIDC path will be redirect. Add `http://localhost:8085/*` and `http://localhost:5000/*` as valid URIs (default URIs for Vue3, .NET, with a wildcard).\n\n- Now, back to the list of clients, open `realm-management` and re-generate the Secret Key like before (take note of it). Check in the \"Roles\" tab that the list of roles is not empty\n\n  \n\nYou may now proceed to create the first of the **Users** in the eponymous tab:\n\n  \n\n- When creating the user make sure to tick the \"email verified\" switch -- it increases the convenience for testing purposes\n\n- You will not see a \"Password\" field and this is normal -- users in KeyCloak may possess zero to many different credentials, which may or may not be passwords.\n\n- Once the user is created, in the \"Credentials\" tab you will be able to set a password. Set a simple one (you are _guaranteed_ to mis-type it at least once) and mark it as **not** temporary\n\n  \n\nThis is enough configuration on this side. Time to create something to authenticate.\n",

        "text": "## Abstract\nThe objective of the project is to create a web-accessible multiplayer open-world game/interactive art exhibit. This project serves as the interactive component for the audience of the Twitch streamer Maghmul (https://twitch.tv/maghmul). This will be played by both Maghmul and his audience while on stream, as well as by the audience alone when Maghmul is not on stream. \n\nThe actual environment where players will be able to run around will be designed and modeled by Maghmul. The intent is to create the infrastructure and interactivity required for Maghmul to keep expanding their digital world using Unity. There is no explicit objective to the game other than to act as a town square for Maghmul's audience and an interactive archive for the models created by Maghmul. \n\n## Phase 1\nFor the first phase of the project, the requirements of the project are as follows:\n1. Import digital environment modeled by Maghmul*\n2. Support for 50+ players present in the world simultaneously using Mirror Networking (formerly UNet)*\n3. Avatar customization for all players and Maghmul\n4. Running and jumping animations for all players of the game*\n5. Toggle between first person and third person view*\n6. Respawn mechanic for players that go out of bounds of the world\n7. Identity management and Login system\n8. Ambient music + creature noises\n9. Customizable draw distance\n10. Proximity voice chat (based on player vicinity to sound source or other player)\n11. Stream a real-time video stream of Maghmul into the Unity environment*\n12. Movement mechanics (WASD/Gamepad + Jump) for players and real-time video stream*\n13. WebGL Deployment and testing \n\n> 1. __* Items with an asterisk are already in progress or nearing completion__\n> 2. __Kindly refer to the videos linked at the bottom of this document for more information on the current status of the project__\n\n## Phase 2 and beyond\nIn subsequent phases of the project, Maghmul would like to:\n1. Be able to use a VR headset for fully body tracking and a more immersive experience for both himself and players\n2. Stream in not just video but a full real-time volumetric capture of his body\n3. Use a webcam to infer his skeletal position and use that as a primitive kind of realtime full body tracking\n4. Allow for user generated content to be brought into the game world \n\n## Ideal Candidate\n1. Would be able to provide fixed-bid quote or estimate for the items listed in Phase 1 following a 4hr introduction to the code base.\n2. Have 3-5 years full-time experience developing games or experiences in Unity  \n3. Have experience using multiplayer assets, ideally Mirror or UNet.\n4. Willing to work no less than 20 and no more than 40 hours per week until Phase 1 completion.\n5. Willing to work remotely and have meetings within UTC+1 working hours \n\n## Interview Process\n1. Submission of portfolio and price range\n2. 30-45 minute online interview with Maghmul and supervisor\n3. Carry out a paid 6-12 hour programming challenge involving 1 of the tasks from Phase 1\n4. Online code review of completed scene and source code with supervisor \n-------\n## asdasd\n1.  The ability for Maghmul and his audience to experience the browser game via a VR/XR headset\n2. Explore various VR + XR motion capture techniques: Vive Trackers, Mocap\nSuits, Webcam mocap, volumetric capture, Quest Pro inside out tracking\n3.\tIntegrate various game mechanics for Maghmul and players\n4.\tVR/XR body modification and alteration tools\n5.\tIn game 3D sculpting and texturing tools\n",

We also sell software products around time tracking and invoicing for use by agencies and independent contractors.\n\n## Timeframes\nDevelopment of the mobile app should take approximately 9 weeks (60 days). After implementation, user acceptance testing on Android and iOS devices will be carried out in parallel with publishing to the Play and App Stores respectively. This publishing process typically takes between 2 weeks and 1 month depending on the extensiveness of the review carried out (typically iOS takes a little bit longer than on Android). We will provide same day support to assist with any issues arising from the mobile app or its integration with Odoo.\n\n## Pricing \nI would opt for the Odoo self-hosted enterprise version. This should translate into a slightly lower annual expense as we would be able to do away with the Odoo.sh Worker Odoo.sh GB and Odoo.sh Staging Branch - and only pay for a hosting provider directly. This should translate into approximately 460€ per year vs 733€. \n\nFurther, if they do not need us to assist with data migration into the new system, I believe we will be able to cut down the Implementation & Setup costs by ~1.5k, down to 3.5k (incl.

By this we mean: \n- The server communicates using the **JSON** format (except for images or other blobs). By extension, requests bodies and responses should be in JSON format.\n\n- The server should be **stateless**, so it can recognize a user only from the data received by the request and a permanent data provider (such as a database).\n\n- The actions performed by the server should be bound to the **HTTP methods**:\n\n-  **GET**: To retrieve the resources\n\n-  **POST**: To create a new resource\n\n-  **PUT**: To update a resource with the full resource\n\n-  **PATCH**: To update a resource with part of the resource\n\n-  **DELETE**: To delete the resource\n\n- Each URL should refer to a **RESOURCE**, such as a list of objects or a single object of the same type.\n\n- The responses provided by the server should take advantage of  **HTTP status codes**. More on this later.\n\n## Standard response\n\nOne of the main things that can help a consumer of the API is to keep a standard **response structure**. This ensures the consumer is able to figure out what happened and understand if a request has been completed successfully, or, if there were any errors, what kind of errors were encountered. \n\nWhile there is no absolute-truth with respect to how to structure such responses, we at Pretty Neat have settled on the following, ripped pretty much verbatim from [JSEND](https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend).\n```\n{\n\t\"status\": \"success\" | \"fail\" | \"error\",\n\t\"data\": any,\n\t\"message\" string\n}\n```\n\n### Status\n\nThe status tell the result of the request:\n- \"success\": the request has no errors\n- \"fail\": the request has errors about the data inserted by the user, like the validation of the body of the request\n- \"error\": the request has errors not managed or an exception has been thrown\n\n#### Success\nA request with the \"status\" = \"success\" has been executed successfully without any problem.\n\nA request of this type is composed by the \"data\" field, with the data replied by the request, and without \"message\".\n\n#### Fail\nA request with the \"status\" = \"fail\" has been executed with problems related to the data inserted by the user (like the validation has failed or the resource is not found because the id inserted does not exists) where an HttpStatusException has been thrown with the status code 400 or 404.\n\nA request of this type is composed by the \"message\" field with the general information about the error and the \"data\" field that can contains the specific informations about the error (like for the validation that contains all the properties that haven't passed the validation and the error messages of them).\n\n#### Error\nA request with the \"status\" = \"error\" has had problems during the execution about not managed/expected errors.\n\nA request of this type is composed by the \"message\" that contains the exception message and, if the application has been built in development mode, the \"data\" field that contains the stack trace of the exception.\n\n## Project structure\n\nDefined our standardized response, here is represented the project structure divided by the different parts:\n\n![Dotnet Api structure](Project structure.png)\n\nIn this structure, are defined the following folders:\n- Controllers: where the entrypoint calls are defined\n- Middlewares: the middlewares of the application\n- Models: where the models of the application are defined (such as database entities, request structure, etc...)\n- Repositories: where is defined how to obtain the data from another source (such as the database)\n- Services: where the business logic of the application resides\n- Utils: the utilities classes are defined there (such as the Exceptions raised inside the application, the Enums, etc...)  \n\n### Controllers\nThe controllers contain the initialization of the endpoints of the application.\nEach controller refer to a resource, so it should manage only that resource or resources strictly connected to it.\nThe controllers should contain as less business logic as possible, they should only manage the stuff related to the format of the requests and the responses.\n\nExamples:\n- convert the body's data received by the request to a format accepted by the service\n- regroup the query params in a single object to send to the service layer for the filters\n- Interact with multiple services\n- manage the exceptions thrown by the service and return a correct response\n\n### Services\nThe business logic resides inside the services and, as the controllers, they manage a resource. If a service needs to get access to related resources, it would contains more repositories (the access to a service from another one could cause a circular dependency).\n \n\n### Repositories\nThe repository is where is defined how and from where retrieve the data, and should refer to an interface in order to do not bind to a specific source of data (i.e.: giving the possibility to change from retrieving the data from a database or from a file without changing the implementation of the code that use this classes).\n\n### Models\nThe models used by the application, such as database objects that represent the single records in the tables (entities), or the objects that the controllers expect to receive as bodies, or the query filters for the GET of each resource, etc...\n\n### Utils\nThe useful classes are contained here, i.e.:\n- Enums\n- Exception that are thrown by the services and then managed by the controllers\n- The manage of the images\n- etc...\n  \n## Dotnet 6 minimal api implementation\nHere I explain how I have implemented it in dotnet 6 with minimal apis.\n\n## Program.cs\n\nInside the entrypoint of the application I have built and instanced the WebApplication with the various configurations, services and middlewares.\n\n## Controllers\nTo initialize the controllers, I inject inside them the WebApplication, from the Program.cs, into the constructors, in order to map the http methods to the controllers methods, and the url prefix to access to the controller that represent a resource.\n\n### Request's body\nThe body object definition that a controller receive are defined either as database entity or as classes, inside the Models.\n\n ### Request's query params\nIn minimal api, the query parameters cannot be defined inside an object, and have to be defined as parameters for each type of them. The controller method contains all the query parameters as method parameters, and then they are converted to a class that is managed inside the service of the resource.  \n\n## Services and repositories\nAll the services and the repositories are provided by the web application service provider and defined as application services during the instance of the services of the WebApplication.\n\n  \n\n## Manage of errors\n\nTo manage the possible errors encountered during the management of the data in the business logic layer (services), some exceptions have been created and inserted inside the `Utils/Exceptions` folder, to define what happened.\n\nThey are thrown inside the business logic and catch in the controllers, or the WebApplication exception handler, to build the response object, as defined before, with the appropriate status code associated to the response.\n\n  \n\n### List of status codes\n\n- 200: Successfull response with attached the object of the response to the body\n\n- 400: Bad request - error with the data provided by the user (incorrect format, missing data, bind of another resource failed because not found)\n\n- 401: Unauthenticated - the user is not recognized by the server (the resource access needs to be logged in, have an authorization, the authorization is expired)\n\n- 403: Unauthorized - the user is recognized by the server but hasn't the privileges to access the resource\n\n- 404: Not Found - the resource is not found (when you get/update/delete the resource by id and the id is not found in the datasource)\n\n- 409: Conflict - there is a conflict between the data in the datasource and the data provided to update/create a resource (i.e.: a record with the same unique constraint is already present)\n",

By extension, requests bodies and responses should be in JSON format.\n\n- The server should be **stateless**, so it can recognize a user only from the data received by the request and a permanent data provider (such as a database).\n\n- The actions performed by the server should be bound to the **HTTP methods**:\n\n-  **GET**: To retrieve the resources\n\n-  **POST**: To create a new resource\n\n-  **PUT**: To update a resource with the full resource\n\n-  **PATCH**: To update a resource with part of the resource\n\n-  **DELETE**: To delete the resource\n\n- Each URL should refer to a **RESOURCE**, such as a list of objects or a single object of the same type.\n\n- The responses provided by the server should take advantage of  **HTTP status codes**. More on this later.\n\n## Standard response\n\nOne of the main things that can help a consumer of the API is to keep a standard **response structure**. This ensures the consumer is able to figure out what happened and understand if a request has been completed successfully, or, if there were any errors, what kind of errors were encountered. \n\nWhile there is no absolute-truth with respect to how to structure such responses, we at Pretty Neat have settled on the following, ripped pretty much verbatim from [JSEND](https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend).\n```\n{\n\t\"status\": \"success\" | \"fail\" | \"error\",\n\t\"data\": any,\n\t\"message\" string\n}\n```\n\n### Status\n\nThe status tell the result of the request:\n- \"success\": the request has no errors\n- \"fail\": the request has errors about the data inserted by the user, like the validation of the body of the request\n- \"error\": the request has errors not managed or an exception has been thrown\n\n#### Success\nA request with the \"status\" = \"success\" has been executed successfully without any problem.\n\nA request of this type is composed by the \"data\" field, with the data replied by the request, and without \"message\".\n\n#### Fail\nA request with the \"status\" = \"fail\" has been executed with problems related to the data inserted by the user (like the validation has failed or the resource is not found because the id inserted does not exists) where an HttpStatusException has been thrown with the status code 400 or 404.\n\nA request of this type is composed by the \"message\" field with the general information about the error and the \"data\" field that can contains the specific informations about the error (like for the validation that contains all the properties that haven't passed the validation and the error messages of them).\n\n#### Error\nA request with the \"status\" = \"error\" has had problems during the execution about not managed/expected errors.\n\nA request of this type is composed by the \"message\" that contains the exception message and, if the application has been built in development mode, the \"data\" field that contains the stack trace of the exception.\n\n## Project structure\n\nDefined our standardized response, here is represented the project structure divided by the different parts:\n\n![Dotnet Api structure](Project structure.png)\n\nIn this structure, are defined the following folders:\n- Controllers: where the entrypoint calls are defined\n- Middlewares: the middlewares of the application\n- Models: where the models of the application are defined (such as database entities, request structure, etc...)\n- Repositories: where is defined how to obtain the data from another source (such as the database)\n- Services: where the business logic of the application resides\n- Utils: the utilities classes are defined there (such as the Exceptions raised inside the application, the Enums, etc...)  \n\n### Controllers\nThe controllers contain the initialization of the endpoints of the application.\nEach controller refer to a resource, so it should manage only that resource or resources strictly connected to it.\nThe controllers should contain as less business logic as possible, they should only manage the stuff related to the format of the requests and the responses.\n\nExamples:\n- convert the body's data received by the request to a format accepted by the service\n- regroup the query params in a single object to send to the service layer for the filters\n- Interact with multiple services\n- manage the exceptions thrown by the service and return a correct response\n\n### Services\nThe business logic resides inside the services and, as the controllers, they manage a resource. If a service needs to get access to related resources, it would contains more repositories (the access to a service from another one could cause a circular dependency).\n \n\n### Repositories\nThe repository is where is defined how and from where retrieve the data, and should refer to an interface in order to do not bind to a specific source of data (i.e.: giving the possibility to change from retrieving the data from a database or from a file without changing the implementation of the code that use this classes).\n\n### Models\nThe models used by the application, such as database objects that represent the single records in the tables (entities), or the objects that the controllers expect to receive as bodies, or the query filters for the GET of each resource, etc...\n\n### Utils\nThe useful classes are contained here, i.e.:\n- Enums\n- Exception that are thrown by the services and then managed by the controllers\n- The manage of the images\n- etc...\n  \n## Dotnet 6 minimal api implementation\nHere I explain how I have implemented it in dotnet 6 with minimal apis.\n\n## Program.cs\n\nInside the entrypoint of the application I have built and instanced the WebApplication with the various configurations, services and middlewares.\n\n## Controllers\nTo initialize the controllers, I inject inside them the WebApplication, from the Program.cs, into the constructors, in order to map the http methods to the controllers methods, and the url prefix to access to the controller that represent a resource.\n\n### Request's body\nThe body object definition that a controller receive are defined either as database entity or as classes, inside the Models.\n\n ### Request's query params\nIn minimal api, the query parameters cannot be defined inside an object, and have to be defined as parameters for each type of them. The controller method contains all the query parameters as method parameters, and then they are converted to a class that is managed inside the service of the resource.  \n\n## Services and repositories\nAll the services and the repositories are provided by the web application service provider and defined as application services during the instance of the services of the WebApplication.\n\n  \n\n## Manage of errors\n\nTo manage the possible errors encountered during the management of the data in the business logic layer (services), some exceptions have been created and inserted inside the `Utils/Exceptions` folder, to define what happened.\n\nThey are thrown inside the business logic and catch in the controllers, or the WebApplication exception handler, to build the response object, as defined before, with the appropriate status code associated to the response.\n\n  \n\n### List of status codes\n\n- 200: Successfull response with attached the object of the response to the body\n\n- 400: Bad request - error with the data provided by the user (incorrect format, missing data, bind of another resource failed because not found)\n\n- 401: Unauthenticated - the user is not recognized by the server (the resource access needs to be logged in, have an authorization, the authorization is expired)\n\n- 403: Unauthorized - the user is recognized by the server but hasn't the privileges to access the resource\n\n- 404: Not Found - the resource is not found (when you get/update/delete the resource by id and the id is not found in the datasource)\n\n- 409: Conflict - there is a conflict between the data in the datasource and the data provided to update/create a resource (i.e.: a record with the same unique constraint is already present)\n",

If there is anything you wish omitted, included or modified from the attached requirements document please let me know at your earliest convenience so I update the document and quotation accordingly.\n\nAs per our prior project together, for fixed bid projects we require 1/3 of the total value upon commencing the project, another 1/3 upon delivery of the codebase, and the remainder once the codebase has been tested from your end. \n\nGiven the highly urgent nature of your request, I suggest we take a slightly different approach from the T&A project in terms of delivery dates so as to not limit our ability to respond to the other ad-hoc requests on the remainder of the front-end of IXALL.\n\nI propose that by the end of each week:\n- We deliver no less than 3 complete sub-modules as described in the attached requirements document.\n- The Datatech team begins a 3 week period of confirming the sub-modules delivered that week met the documented requirements. During this 3 week period we will bugfix and patch anything that doesn't meet the documented requirements (at no extra cost). \n\nThis would mean that if the project is confirmed this coming week, we will deliver the first 3 sub-modules by February 10th and the final sub-modules will be delivered by March 17th.\n\nFinally, it bears repeating that the attached requirements document will be treated as the ultimate source of truth. If you require any changes which are not included in the requirements document after we begin the works, these would fall outside of the scope of the fixed bid and would need to be billed hourly or quoted separately. \n\n",

If there is anything you wish omitted, included or modified from the attached requirements document please let me know at your earliest convenience so I update the document and quotation accordingly.\n\nAs per our prior project together, for fixed bid projects we require 1/3 of the total value upon commencing the project, another 1/3 upon delivery of the codebase, and the remainder once the codebase has been tested from your end. \n\nGiven the highly urgent nature of your request, I suggest we take a slightly different approach from the T&A project in terms of delivery dates so as to not limit our ability to respond to the other ad-hoc requests on the remainder of the front-end of IXALL.\n\nI propose that by the end of each week:\n- We deliver no less than 3 complete sub-modules as described in the attached requirements document.\n- The Datatech team begins a 3 week period of confirming the sub-modules delivered that week met the documented requirements. During this 3 week period we will bugfix and patch anything that doesn't meet the documented requirements (at no extra cost). \n\nThis would mean that if the project is confirmed this coming week, we will deliver the first 3 sub-modules by February 10th and the final sub-modules will be delivered by March 17th.\n\nFinally, it bears repeating that the attached requirements document will be treated as the ultimate source of truth. If you require any changes which are not included in the requirements document after we begin the works, these would fall outside of the scope of the fixed bid and would need to be billed hourly or quoted separately. \n\n",

Can a goal be assigned to an employee without any appraisal? (assuming yes atm, in so far as goals are totally separate from appraisals save for previewing them inside the review) \n> Yes. \n7. Any specific requirements for the Manage Appraisal screens? (23)\n> Manage appraisals looks like team performance. Basic search (name), sort by dept or employee name or employee number \n8. Any specific requirements for the Dashboard screen? \n> Skip. \n9. Any specific requirements for the Reporting screen?  \n>  None, just include print functionality (even if incomplete) in My/Team Performance (include signature). Print out should view whatever i am eligible to see (ie if employee, only employee responses)\n10. What is the data source for 'My Story'? Is this something we must handle?\n> Skip, just use placeholder.\n11. What does build my performance link to?\n> Skip for now. \n12. Are 'Performance' and 'Periods Covered' derived from last submitted appraisal?\n> Yes. \n13. Where can I get who has the HR Manager and HR Worker roles? What should happen if there are none? (9)\n> HR Manager: Whoever has access to Slide 37 onwards\n> HR Worker: Whoever has rights to 5 - 15\n14. Are the tiers specified as part of the Template phase or this created on a per employee basis? (38)\n> Per template\n15. What does Part 1 mean? (38)\n> Participant 1\n16.

Who is 'By Yourself' in Team Performance?\n> First person\n20. Will appraisals and goals be created and assigned one at a time, or in bulk?\n21. Setup Screens\n> All need the quick action bar\n\n\n\n",

However in all cases printers are very fickle and frequently require a silly amount of time to get working.\n\n1. Open the old Control Panel via the start menu, or by pressing WinKey + R, and typing in 'control.exe' in the input, and hitting OK.\n\n2. Select Hardware and Sound\n\n3. Select Add a Device\n\n4. In the new window, select Printers & Scanners\n\n5. Select Add Device\n\n6. If the desired device is listed there, go ahead and add it.\n\n7. If it is not, after some time the option 'My device is not listed' will appear. Click it.\n\n8. Go to the physical printer and get the IP Address from its network settings.\n\n9. Select 'Add printer using IP address or hostname'\n\n10. In the device type dropdown, select Autodetect device, input the IP address into the first input and tick the 'Query the printer...' tickbox.\n\n11. Hit Next\n\n12. If it worked, you should get a succes message.\n\n13. If it didn't, tell them to wait till I'm back.\n\n  \n\n## How to Restart All Servers\n\n> We will use remote desktop to connect to the hyper-visor server, and restart the machine. The servers render graphics and boot up very slowly, so please be patient with them.\n\n1. Open Remote Desktop.\n\n2. Input SRV-INS-HV02.inspectra.local and hit Connect\n\n3. Open the start menu, and restart the server normally (like it was a normal Windows pc).\n\n4. It will prompt you to give a reason for why you're shutting down - select Unplanned from the list, and input a note as to why you're restarting the server then proceed.\n\n5. It will take ~40 minutes to restart all the servers. Be patient. During this time the MIS, X Drive, and VPN will stop working.\n\n  \n\n## How to Restart a Specific Server\n\n> We will use remote desktop to connect to the hyper-visor server, and manually restart one of the virtual machines in Hyper-V manager. The servers render graphics and boot up very slowly, so please be patient with them.\n\n1. Open Remote Desktop\n\n2. Input SRV-INS-HV02.inspectra.local and hit Connect\n\n3. In the start menu type in Hyper-V Manager (or HyperV - it will take a while to show up) - click it.\n\n4. A new window should appear with 3 panes. Once it loads, in the center pane, there shuold be a list of servers starting with **SRV-INS-**\n\n5. Right click on the server that you would to restart and select Reboot (or Restart) from the options, or Shutdown (to tell it to restart normally), or Terminate (or Switch Off, to 'kill the power' to the machine abruptly).\n\n6. If you reboot or shut it down and start it again, it will take between 5 and 30 minutes to reboot.\n\n  \n\n## Reset a Password Remotely\n\n> We will use remote desktop to connect to the hyper-visor server, and restart the machine. The servers render graphics and boot up very slowly, so please be patient with them.\n\n1. Open Remote Desktop.\n\n2. Input SRV-INS-FS01.inspectra.local and hit Connect\n\n3. From the start menu open Active Directory Users and Groups\n\n4. In the new window that opens, in the top menu bar there should be a search icon (with a magnifying glass). Click it.\n\n5. Search for the relevant user by the first and/or last name\n\n6. Right click on the returned user, and select Reset Password.\n\n7. Input the new password twice, hit OK.\n\n  \n\n## Reset Own Password\n\n1. Log into your account\n\n2. Hit CTRL+ALT+DELETE\n\n3. In the new full screen overlay, select Reset Password\n\n4. Input your current password, and your new password twice to reset it\n\n  \n\n## Spare Webcam\n\n> You can take mine from my desk, or the one in the Serialization Room (downstairs, by the conveyor) for a higher quality camera/microphone combination.\n\n  \n\n## Grant access to folder\n\n> Manually add them directly to the folder rather than using Groups - just please be sure to take note of which folders you grant to who, so that I can subsequently move them into the correct group and revoke the permission.\n\n  \n\n## Installing Software\n\n- For installing office, go to Office.com and sign in. Once signed in, you should be greeted by a sort of dashboard - on the top right there is a button \"Install Office\". Clicking it should trigger a download.\n\n- For installing MCSU software, double check the source of the program that needs to be installed by asking a technician to show you where they got it. If it is legitimate, just install it normally using Admin rights if needed. Shaun or Giueseppe should have any licenses.\n\n  \n\n## MCSU Hard Disk\n\n- The technicians should have the hard disk and know how to operate it. If they encounter an issue, take the slow laptop (that has a damaged screen with a black circle) from the cupboards to the left of the exit of the Pretty Neat office (should be in lower shelves).\n\n  \n\n## Connect to VPN\n\n- The network name to use is mail.inspectra.eu:4433. Use your inspectra credentials (ex krisc and regular password). There should be a copy of the WatchguardVPN program they need in our chat on Teams. If you can't find it, ask Ilya as he should have a copy also. In case of emergency, Neville can assist with VPN issues.\n\nHi Mar  \n  \nAttached find instructions on how to tackle the issues we discussed (listed below):\n\nAdd Printer\n\nHow to Restart All Servers\n\nHow to Restart a Specific Server\n\nReset Password Remotely\n\nReset Own Password\n\nSpare Webcam\n\nGrant access to folder\n\nInstalling Software\n\nMCSU Hard Disk\n  \nRegards\n",

Always display goal progress for this employee if there are any goals (irrespective of it they have an appraisal or not).\n2. When no appraisal is assigned, display dropdown with Appraisal Templates which are marked as Complete. Saving assigns the appraisal to the specified employee.\n3. Once an appraisal is assigned, display a link which opens the modal to select who else assigned to this appraisal for this employee. Use default values for the Superior and Manager (others are not mandatory, and can be assigned manually).\n4. If appraisal is assigned, then display all the people assigned to said appraisal (if any) aside from the current employee.\n\n- [ ] My Performance\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8969913/224689569-4b49749c-d296-40eb-a33b-9cce042e7d1b.png)\n5. Display currently active, or last active Appraisal information (as per image, performance Type is the Appraisal Template Name)\n6. 'Contribute to my review' should link to the Appraisal form allowing the user to respond to the questions.\n7. Show summary should display a summary of the scores submitted by the employee, divided per section. \n8. Clicking on the scores for specific questions should open the Appraisal and scroll to the appropriate section and question allowing the user to edit their submission (if it is not marked as Complete).\n9. Hitting the save button, once all questions have answers (ie each has an employee submitted score) will set the appraisal status as Ready for Review.\n10. Beneath the summary a notes field should be present which will act as a Note for the whole Appraisal submitted by the employee.  \n![enter image description here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8969913/224722095-8580ae4f-948e-48b9-9b82-ffe8ec5f7f2f.png)\n\n#### Appraisal \n- [x] Appraisal Designer\n- [ ] Manage Appraisals\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8969913/224723755-1cfeda19-736e-449c-a038-715203e9e64d.png)\n1.

Paginated list view displaying appraisals' Profile picture, Name and surname, Goal completion, The Employee’s direct superior, Deadline for them to submit their appraisal\n5. Above paginated list, display Create Appraisal button.\n6. Create Appraisal is a simple page with 2x autocomplete to select a) An Employee (must not have an appraisal) b) A Template (must be Published)\n7. List only Appraisals assigned to you (in any capacity - superior, participant, etc…) unless HR Manager\n8. HR Manager can view all Appraisals, and change their status. They cannot modify answers or scores.\n9. Appraisal statuses are: Not started, Progress, Completed, Posted, Reviewed, Processed, Archived, Cancelled, On hold.\n10.

                "text": "\n  \n\n## Add Printer\n\n> These instructions apply to Windows 11. Windows 10 should be similar. However in all cases printers are very fickle and frequently require a silly amount of time to get working.\n\n1. Open the old Control Panel via the start menu, or by pressing WinKey + R, and typing in 'control.exe' in the input, and hitting OK.\n\n2. Select Hardware and Sound\n\n3. Select Add a Device\n\n4. In the new window, select Printers & Scanners\n\n5. Select Add Device\n\n6. If the desired device is listed there, go ahead and add it.\n\n7. If it is not, after some time the option 'My device is not listed' will appear. Click it.\n\n8. Go to the physical printer and get the IP Address from its network settings.\n\n9. Select 'Add printer using IP address or hostname'\n\n10. In the device type dropdown, select Autodetect device, input the IP address into the first input and tick the 'Query the printer...' tickbox.\n\n11. Hit Next\n\n12. If it worked, you should get a succes message.\n\n13. If it didn't, tell them to wait till I'm back.\n\n  \n\n## How to Restart All Servers\n\n> We will use remote desktop to connect to the hyper-visor server, and restart the machine. The servers render graphics and boot up very slowly, so please be patient with them.\n\n1. Open Remote Desktop.\n\n2. Input SRV-INS-HV02.inspectra.local and hit Connect\n\n3. Open the start menu, and restart the server normally (like it was a normal Windows pc).\n\n4. It will prompt you to give a reason for why you're shutting down - select Unplanned from the list, and input a note as to why you're restarting the server then proceed.\n\n5. It will take ~40 minutes to restart all the servers. Be patient. During this time the MIS, X Drive, and VPN will stop working.\n\n  \n\n## How to Restart a Specific Server\n\n> We will use remote desktop to connect to the hyper-visor server, and manually restart one of the virtual machines in Hyper-V manager. The servers render graphics and boot up very slowly, so please be patient with them.\n\n1. Open Remote Desktop\n\n2. Input SRV-INS-HV02.inspectra.local and hit Connect\n\n3. In the start menu type in Hyper-V Manager (or HyperV - it will take a while to show up) - click it.\n\n4. A new window should appear with 3 panes. Once it loads, in the center pane, there shuold be a list of servers starting with **SRV-INS-**\n\n5. Right click on the server that you would to restart and select Reboot (or Restart) from the options, or Shutdown (to tell it to restart normally), or Terminate (or Switch Off, to 'kill the power' to the machine abruptly).\n\n6. If you reboot or shut it down and start it again, it will take between 5 and 30 minutes to reboot.\n\n  \n\n## Reset a Password Remotely\n\n> We will use remote desktop to connect to the hyper-visor server, and restart the machine. The servers render graphics and boot up very slowly, so please be patient with them.\n\n1. Open Remote Desktop.\n\n2. Input SRV-INS-FS01.inspectra.local and hit Connect\n\n3. From the start menu open Active Directory Users and Groups\n\n4. In the new window that opens, in the top menu bar there should be a search icon (with a magnifying glass). Click it.\n\n5. Search for the relevant user by the first and/or last name\n\n6. Right click on the returned user, and select Reset Password.\n\n7. Input the new password twice, hit OK.\n\n  \n\n## Reset Own Password\n\n1. Log into your account\n\n2. Hit CTRL+ALT+DELETE\n\n3. In the new full screen overlay, select Reset Password\n\n4. Input your current password, and your new password twice to reset it\n\n  \n\n## Spare Webcam\n\n> You can take mine from my desk, or the one in the Serialization Room (downstairs, by the conveyor) for a higher quality camera/microphone combination.\n\n  \n\n## Grant access to folder\n\n> Manually add them directly to the folder rather than using Groups - just please be sure to take note of which folders you grant to who, so that I can subsequently move them into the correct group and revoke the permission.\n\n  \n\n## Installing Software\n\n- For installing office, go to Office.com and sign in. Once signed in, you should be greeted by a sort of dashboard - on the top right there is a button \"Install Office\". Clicking it should trigger a download.\n\n- For installing MCSU software, double check the source of the program that needs to be installed by asking a technician to show you where they got it. If it is legitimate, just install it normally using Admin rights if needed. Shaun or Giueseppe should have any licenses.\n\n  \n\n## MCSU Hard Disk\n\n- The technicians should have the hard disk and know how to operate it. If they encounter an issue, take the slow laptop (that has a damaged screen with a black circle) from the cupboards to the left of the exit of the Pretty Neat office (should be in lower shelves).\n\n  \n\n## Connect to VPN\n\n- The network name to use is mail.inspectra.eu:4433. Use your inspectra credentials (ex krisc and regular password). There should be a copy of the WatchguardVPN program they need in our chat on Teams. If you can't find it, ask Ilya as he should have a copy also. In case of emergency, Neville can assist with VPN issues.\n\nHi Mar  \n  \nAttached find instructions on how to tackle the issues we discussed (listed below):\n\nAdd Printer\n\nHow to Restart All Servers\n\nHow to Restart a Specific Server\n\nReset Password Remotely\n\nReset Own Password\n\nSpare Webcam\n\nGrant access to folder\n\nInstalling Software\n\nMCSU Hard Disk\n  \nRegards\n",

                "text": "## Abstract\nThe objective of the project is to create a web-accessible multiplayer open-world game/interactive art exhibit. This project serves as the interactive component for the audience of the Twitch streamer Maghmul (https://twitch.tv/maghmul). This will be played by both Maghmul and his audience while on stream, as well as by the audience alone when Maghmul is not on stream. \n\nThe actual environment where players will be able to run around will be designed and modeled by Maghmul. The intent is to create the infrastructure and interactivity required for Maghmul to keep expanding their digital world using Unity. There is no explicit objective to the game other than to act as a town square for Maghmul's audience and an interactive archive for the models created by Maghmul. \n\n## Phase 1\nFor the first phase of the project, the requirements of the project are as follows:\n1. Import digital environment modeled by Maghmul*\n2. Support for 50+ players present in the world simultaneously using Mirror Networking (formerly UNet)*\n3. Avatar customization for all players and Maghmul\n4. Running and jumping animations for all players of the game*\n5. Toggle between first person and third person view*\n6. Respawn mechanic for players that go out of bounds of the world\n7. Identity management and Login system\n8. Ambient music + creature noises\n9. Customizable draw distance\n10. Proximity voice chat (based on player vicinity to sound source or other player)\n11. Stream a real-time video stream of Maghmul into the Unity environment*\n12. Movement mechanics (WASD/Gamepad + Jump) for players and real-time video stream*\n13. WebGL Deployment and testing \n\n> 1. __* Items with an asterisk are already in progress or nearing completion__\n> 2. __Kindly refer to the videos linked at the bottom of this document for more information on the current status of the project__\n\n## Phase 2 and beyond\nIn subsequent phases of the project, Maghmul would like to:\n1. Be able to use a VR headset for fully body tracking and a more immersive experience for both himself and players\n2. Stream in not just video but a full real-time volumetric capture of his body\n3. Use a webcam to infer his skeletal position and use that as a primitive kind of realtime full body tracking\n4. Allow for user generated content to be brought into the game world \n\n## Ideal Candidate\n1. Would be able to provide fixed-bid quote or estimate for the items listed in Phase 1 following a 4hr introduction to the code base.\n2. Have 3-5 years full-time experience developing games or experiences in Unity  \n3. Have experience using multiplayer assets, ideally Mirror or UNet.\n4. Willing to work no less than 20 and no more than 40 hours per week until Phase 1 completion.\n5. Willing to work remotely and have meetings within UTC+1 working hours \n\n## Interview Process\n1. Submission of portfolio and price range\n2. 30-45 minute online interview with Maghmul and supervisor\n3. Carry out a paid 6-12 hour programming challenge involving 1 of the tasks from Phase 1\n4. Online code review of completed scene and source code with supervisor \n-------\n## asdasd\n1.  The ability for Maghmul and his audience to experience the browser game via a VR/XR headset\n2. Explore various VR + XR motion capture techniques: Vive Trackers, Mocap\nSuits, Webcam mocap, volumetric capture, Quest Pro inside out tracking\n3.\tIntegrate various game mechanics for Maghmul and players\n4.\tVR/XR body modification and alteration tools\n5.\tIn game 3D sculpting and texturing tools\n",

Overview of OFICI services as they relate to the core operations of the business: Printing Services, Office Supplies, and Office Furniture. \n2. Overview of the modules and features available within Odoo.\n3. Launch date for the CRM and Customer management systems using Odoo as the 1st of September.\n4. Training to be provided for the first 2 modules during the week of the 21st August. \n5. Over the subsequent 3 months, additional Odoo modules will be added to accommodate the below business requirements:\n\t  - Accounting\n\t  - Purchase Orders & Invoicing\n\t  - Quotations and Sales\n\t  - Employee Management\n\t  - Help desk (for after-sales support)\n\t  - Website Builder\n\t  - Ecommerce (without payments provider integration for now)\n\t  - Appointment Scheduling\n\t  - Inventory Management\n\t  - Vendor Management\n\t  - Timesheets \n\t  - Document Signing \n6. We discussed the availability of government grants to recoup expenses such as the Business Enhance RRP Digitalisation or the Business Enhance RRP Digital Intensification as seen [here](https://sem.gov.mt/open-calls?search-funding-organisation=All&search-funding-interest=All&search-funding-programme=4bkra9fk78xsb15611ryr4bydq). Unfortunately it seems the eCommerce grant closed in 2022. \n7. For the marketing, quotation and other emails outgoing from Odoo, an email address will be used based on the forthcoming communications with PCGen. \n8. I will be providing you an environment to poke around the relevant modules by end of this week.\n\nFrom your end, we will be requiring the below prior to being able to provide an estimate for works needed for the initial setup and training session.\n\t- Full name and email of the 4-6 initial users that will be participating in the training or need access to the first 2 modules.\n\t- The various stages in the Customer Retention and Business Development pipelines so we try prepare the environment and training around your existing processes. \n\t- A line of communication with PCGen with your good self in copy as it relates to the setting up of an email address for outreach from the Odoo system. \n\nUpon receiving the above I will put together an estimate for the coming weeks of setup and training for your review. Should it be approved in a timely manner, we are confident we will be able to deliver the urgent deliverables within your 1st September timeline. \n\nKind Regards\nKris\n",

This module allows staff or their caretakers (ex brother, parent) to upload their medical expenses along with information about their conditions in order to receive payment for their treatments from the company. A company appointed Doctor subsequently reviews the uploaded documents and information, matches it with the appropriate medical expense or treatment, and approves or denies the claim. Finally, company administrators (ex HR Manager) can review this and issue compensation as part of the employee's wage via the Events system. \n\n- Internationalisation of values and labels to be handled by Datatech\n- All tables, elements and text must support Right-To-Left layout\n- Estimate and requirements subject to change following Justin's provision of Figma Screens\n- Disregard backend permissions, use only Frontend permission system\n- Information about the reports to be provided later\n\n## Employee or Guardian\n - Employee can login using related user information\n - Guardians can have normal user credentials without being associated to any employee. \n - Can view and add to health history of current employee\n - Can view doctor's recommendations of current employee\n - New Claim screen \n\t - Display Employee Name, Last Invoice Date, Relative Relations (ie relationship with guardian - parent/sibling/etc...)\n\t - Upload one or more invoices as PDF or Image\n\t - Upload one or more prescriptions as PDF or Image \n\t - Specify the Service Type (from dropdown list)\n\t - Service Type coverage and percentage should be automatically populated (see note below)\n\t - Specify Invoice value (total of all invoices) and date\n\t - Specify Service Provider (ex. Mater Dei)\n\t - Each employee has a maximum coverage per year (calculated as 1st January till December 31st), of which a percentage will be reimbursed by the company \n\t - When multiple separate invoices are uploaded and user clicks to display them - display them all in the same modal.\n- The Claims module should be componentized as it will be reused for the Doctor and inside of Employee Master\n\n> Service Type coverage value and coverage percentage (derived from lookup table page 10) appended to screen in page 4 (as this is the amount the that the employee will be reimbursed). Also include calculated total renumeration based on service type selected (if value covered is 1k, and coverage is 90% then the maximum compensation PER YEAR is 900. Therefore, if the employee has a 3k bill for Medical Chairs, and the max coverage is 1000 @ 90%, then the employee will be covered 900 worth of treatment. The remaining 2100 will be paid for by the employee. We need to display this validation of 'compensation provided by company = 900' and 'expense incurred by employee 2100' . Also display total compensation for this service type this year.\n\n## Doctor\n- Can review all the information uploaded by the employee. Can also overwrite everything except the file uploads.\n- Can upload, modify and delete Prescriptions, Diagnoses, Medicines, and Service Types\n- Can view Invoice History for all employees \n- Table view to select the patient.

Provided that if the Lessor provides his consent, for this lease agreement to be transferred, the Lessee must pay the sum of two thousand Euros (€2,000) to the Lessors and the lease shall be assigned under the same terms and conditions.\n\nThe Lessee may sublet the lease in whole or in part solely in favor of the Cannabis Harm-Reduction Association (CHRA) and provided that the Lessee notifies the Lessor in writing at least [•] days before the commencement of the said sub-lease.\n\nIf at any time of the duration of this lease, it results that the Lessee has sublet of assigned this lease, whether in whole or in part, in breach of the aforementioned clauses, this lease shall be deemed terminated ipso jure without the necessity of any judicial proceedings and the Lessors shall have the right to take over the possession of the leased premises and this without prejudice to Lessor’s right to claim from the Lessee any outstanding rent, any outstanding utility bills, or any amounts which may be due at the time of such termination including any damages which the Lessee may have occasioned or permitted to be occasioned in the lease premises, and including any loss of earnings or loss of profit.\"\n",

Overview of OFICI services as they relate to the core operations of the business: Printing Services, Office Supplies, and Office Furniture. \n2. Overview of the modules and features available within Odoo.\n3. Launch date for the CRM and Customer management systems using Odoo as the 1st of September.\n4. Training to be provided for the first 2 modules during the week of the 21st August. \n5. Over the subsequent 3 months, additional Odoo modules will be added to accommodate the below business requirements:\n\t  - Accounting\n\t  - Purchase Orders & Invoicing\n\t  - Quotations and Sales\n\t  - Employee Management\n\t  - Help desk (for after-sales support)\n\t  - Website Builder\n\t  - Ecommerce (without payments provider integration for now)\n\t  - Appointment Scheduling\n\t  - Inventory Management\n\t  - Vendor Management\n\t  - Timesheets \n\t  - Document Signing \n6. We discussed the availability of government grants to recoup expenses such as the Business Enhance RRP Digitalisation or the Business Enhance RRP Digital Intensification as seen [here](https://sem.gov.mt/open-calls?search-funding-organisation=All&search-funding-interest=All&search-funding-programme=4bkra9fk78xsb15611ryr4bydq). Unfortunately it seems the eCommerce grant closed in 2022. \n7. For the marketing, quotation and other emails outgoing from Odoo, an email address will be used based on the forthcoming communications with PCGen. \n8. I will be providing you an environment to poke around the relevant modules by end of this week.\n\nFrom your end, we will be requiring the below prior to being able to provide an estimate for works needed for the initial setup and training session.\n\t- Full name and email of the 4-6 initial users that will be participating in the training or need access to the first 2 modules.\n\t- The various stages in the Customer Retention and Business Development pipelines so we try prepare the environment and training around your existing processes. \n\t- A line of communication with PCGen with your good self in copy as it relates to the setting up of an email address for outreach from the Odoo system. \n\nUpon receiving the above I will put together an estimate for the coming weeks of setup and training for your review. Should it be approved in a timely manner, we are confident we will be able to deliver the urgent deliverables within your 1st September timeline. \n\nKind Regards\nKris\n",

        "text": "Hey Gilbert \n\nBelow find a bit of a breakdown of how we have worked with Miles so far. I have written it in the third person so that it's clear to anyone reading it who the relevant parties are. \n\nPrior to digging into the individual causes for the total value of the invoices, I think it's important to quickly go over the terms of  the agreement between MilesXP and Pretty Neat. We were approached to quote for a system against a set of specifications provided by Gilbert. At the time of quoting, the specifications were very detailed in some areas (ex. Customer, Bookings, Quotations), and somewhat high level in others (ex. Driver). \n\nWe provided an estimate of 48K which had with it 3 compensation options:\n1. Paid in advance, 100 hours at a time - with justification of each batch of 100 hours to be consumed prior to issuing.  \n2. Billed hourly for time and materials (allowing for changes in requirements).\n3. Fixed bid, with an additional 30% contingency over and above the 48K - paid in 3 instalments (upon commencement, upon delivery, upon completing of testing) and disallowing for changes in requirements.\n\nMilesXP signed off on approach 2, wherein we would bill for any time spent working on this project on a pro-rata basis. We have been working using this approach for 2.5 years. Last year was the first instance of very delayed payments from Miles' end (> 90 days credit). Following some chasing by the Inspectra Finance department, all dues were ultimately settled. This has happened again this year, however no-one is responding to the Finance department's calls for payment. In light of this, initially verbally during a meeting in August with Pierguido, and subsequently both in person and in writing 2 weeks ago to David and Pierguido - I reminded Miles XP of their payment obligations and made it clear that we will not be able to keep working the way we presently as of next quarter - without payments being settled, or a mutually agreed upon way-forward at the very least.\n\nFollowing this, an investigation into the invoices issued (over 6 months ago) begun from Miles' end - leading to their confusion regarding what was part of the original specifications and what wasn't. At a high level (as I explained to David and Pierguido in person 2 weeks ago) this can be broken down into 3 categories of expenses. \n\n1. Core Requirements\nWe initially estimated 48K for these core requirements. Due to relatively minor changes throughout the course of the development, the final costs thus far for the Core requirements are at 54K - reflecting a 13% increase over the initial estimate. We received the detailed flow diagrams for this solution (12/12/2021) after the contract with Miles had been signed (24/08/2021). We would not have accepted this had we not agreed to work on a Time and Materials basis (as changes in requirements would not be permitted for fixed-bid contracts).   \nFor other projects, when all requirements are set in stone and we are working on a fixed bid, we take a contingency of 30% for any unknown unknowns encountered during development. In this case, the requirements actually changed - aside from the plethora of unknown unknowns encountered on a project of this scale - and we are still just 13% off the mark as of September 2023 (despite Phase 1 of the project running 1.5 years longer than planned). \n\n2. Infrastructure Requirements (Development, Staging and Production)\nAt the time of the quotation being accepted, no information was provided about working with a 3rd party who would be handling the infrastructure, nor was there any information that there would be an automated development, staging and production environment which we would not be able to manage and monitor directly - nor that we would be guiding and assisting the third party (ie not just doing it ourselves) as to how to host our Dotnet and Vue applications. The tooling used by 56Bit is not the tooling we are accustomed to - so a non-trivial amount of time was spent adapting it to their processes. This is not to say that 56Bit have not done a good job of their work - it is only to emphasize that we are just billing for these requests as we receive them as we never accounted for them in our initial estimate. I have gone ahead and attached the requirements document provided by 56Bit - to provide a bit of context onto how much technical complexity there is, and how many different AWS services are involved. This unfortunately, was not a simple matter of tossing our code over the wall and letting the other guys handle it - and alot more like changing the foundation of a building while trying to renovate it's insides. \n\n3. Driver App Requirements\nThe only Driver related element that we quoted for was the ability for users' to be classified as a driver and to log the status changes associated with a booking done by the driver.  This was 1 page in the 43 page requirements document that we quoted against.  The first formal driver-specific requirements document was received on the 18/01/2022 (document attached) delineated what was our responsibility and what was Rubber Duck's. Everything marked in blue was assumed to be Rubber Duck's responsibility (as per the mail cited below) This did not turn out to be accurate as we ended up building all the API for each of the items that Rubber Duck built a frontend for. \n\t> \"As per our conversation, please find RFP with a text mark in blue which would need to be developed by Rubber Duck while all other unmarked text will be handled by the API except for the front-end development which you would still need to handle.\"\n\nIn the case of both 56Bit and Rubber Duck, we were instructed to support them as needed - and more recently, we were instructed to note the time spent supporting both companies as separate line items. This has been present in every monthly invoice as from at least February this year. In fact, they are the only line items appearing in all of the outstanding dues owed to Pretty Neat. Attached find an Excel file detailing where time was spent (beyond the original requirements). \n\nIf there is a problem with the current approach and Miles would prefer to work on a pay-in-advance basis or to re-quote prior to commencing any changes, then it is absolutely not a problem for us. Ultimately we are flexible and will work with whatever process or pace the client prefers.  \n\nThat said, all outstanding and overdue bills must be settled - and the quantities billed are not up for negotiation. This is effort and wages that have already been spent, and the period for contesting such invoices having long past as per the terms stated in the contract and invoices. We have not exercised our right to halt further works or charge interest as of yet - nor do we want to. The MilesXP operational staff and the team of contractors assembled really is an excellent collection of people - and ultimately we want this project to succeed and for both business to continue collaborating in the long term. \n\nUltimately, I think this failure in process comes down to the following:\n1. An incorrect assumption by Gilbert (due to a failure in communication by Miles team) that we were working against a fixed bid.\n2. A failure to process invoices issued by Pretty Neat in a timely manner.\n3. Pretty Neat not insisting _formally_ on being paid sooner. We did this verbally during meetings and via our finance department - but evidently not enough directly to the Miles administration team in writing. This would have allowed for more run-way to allow Miles to investigate their billing issues before having to halt services.\n\nHopefully this clears up our position, and makes clear what assumptions we have been operating under. \n\nKind Regards\n\n",

At present, personnel and vehicles enter via the same gate, however additional gates will be present in the future. Boats are not admitted at present, but the infrastructure should allow handling of boats. \n\n## User Permissions\n### Administrator (Admin)\n1. Can modify all entities\n2. Can approve or deny anyone\n3. Can generate reports\n4. Has full access\n\n### Security Officer (SO)\n1. Can create visitor passes\n2. Can let people in and out and specify reason\n\n### Responsible Person (RP)\n1. Can create any pass for members of their department\n2. Can modify all entities directly associated with members of their department\n3. Can approve or deny for members of their department\n4. Can be many responsible people within a department\n\n## Core \n### Add New Pass\n> Admin, SO, RP\n1. Select Pass Type (Personnel, Vehicle, Boat)\n2. Select Pass Duration \n\t- Permanent - Pass for employee without an expiration (Admin, RP)\n\t- Pre-Approved -  Fixed period pass (for now or future), collect category, requires photo, auto-expires after fixed period (Admin, RP)\n\t- Visitor - Single day pass (for now or future), collect category, auto-expires at end of specified day (Admin, RP, SO)\n3. Pass category denotes what kind of personnel the pass is for (ex. subcontractor, supplier, employee, freight maintenance, etc...). Each pass category has different date and time restrictions as to when they can access the facilities (ex. Pre-Approved pass for Contractor = Monday - Friday: 9 - 5, Saturday 9 - 12, Sunday none). The date and time restriction are described in the Pass Category, but inherited by every personnel using said Duration and Category combination. (Admin)\n4. Input known personnel information. (Admin, RP, SO)\n5. Multiple passes can be issued to the same person, so long as the active periods for the pass do not overlap. \n6. Vehicle is associated with an entry (entrance or exit), but not a person directly. Multiple people can enter via the same vehicle at the same time. \n7. Token for invitation lasts 1 month and can be cancelled. Additional people can be added via the same token indefinitely. Each person added shows up as their own approval.\n8. Input known personnel information. (Admin, RP, SO)\n9. For Permanent, Pre-Approved or Visitor:  Send invitation link for one or more personnel including user specified pass type, duration, category and reference number. Quantity of people to be input as part of invitationand category. Recipients are to fill in any missing values via a form linked in the email.  Can be one or many users in a single email (ex. MMH invite multiple members of staff from PrettyNeat by sending me the invitation link and I input details for each personnel who needs access). Once form filled in and submitted, MMH are notified via email and within the app - with each individual enlisted having their own approval.  (Admin, RP)\n10. For Visitor Passes: Information can be input with the personnel/vehicle/boat's information input in-person by the visitor with the supervision of the SO. In this case, no invitation email is sent and the information is NOT automatically approved - it still needs manual approval by RP or Admin. The relevant pass PDF and QR Code are sent to the input email address, and can be downloaded and printed manually by the SO. \n11. MMH approve or deny the request, modifying any submitted information as needed. (Admin, RP)\n12. Once approved, the personnel/vehicle/boat's pass is issued in the form of a PDF sent as an attachment via email, including the generated QR Code and the personnel's photograph if any. This can be resent via the administration panel (Admin, RP). The personnel cannot modify their own information after they have submit the form. \n13. If denied, notify the personnel involved with the reason for the denial. \n14. On first use of a pass by the SO, disable submit button until the SO manually ticks the 'Vetted ID Card' button (to verify details of personnel on first use).\n\n### Manage Passes\n> The Admin can carry out all actions. \n> The RP can only view and interact with passes associated with personnel and vehicles assigned to their Team.\n> The SO can only view pass information and create visitor passes.  \n1.  Create (see previous section), Read, Update, Delete, and List view of all Passes with conditional Quick Actions\n2. Display columns\n\t- Pass status\n\t- Personnel, Vehicle, or Boat information\n\t- Last Entry or Exit time\n\t- Expiration Date\n\t- Job (Reference) Number\n\t- Personnel Category (ex. Client, Supplier)\n\t- Pass Type\n\t- Active Hours (today)\n3. Quick Actions (Admin, RP)\n\t- If pending form fill, none.\n\t- If form filled in, enable Respond button. Upon clicking, display a modal for more information and Approve or Deny buttons.\n\t- If approved, Print or Resend (to different address) pass button which will open the PDF Pass in a new tab. \n4. When selecting a single pass\n\t- Display entry logs associated with a pass, including any relevant vehicle info\n\t- Display personnel photo\n\t- Display personnel information\n5. Multi-stage filters - allowing one to filter by one or more columns\n6. Automated notification via email to personnel about \n\t- Single Invitation (with Form)\n\t- Multi-Person Invitation (with Form)\n\t- Approval (with Pass PDF)\n\t- Denial (with reason)\n\n### Manage Entry Logs\n1. View and update functionality for \n2. Entry log reports for: \n\t- Current table view with filters applied\n\t- Personnel punched in but not out\n\t- Vehicles punched in but not out\n\t- Personnel let in outside of their allocated hours\n\t- View list of personnel on-site at the moment (ie not punched out)\n3.  Add an entry to track personnel entry or exit (ie punch in or out)\n4. Track personnel or vehicle entry or exit, and from which gate\n5. Punch out of one or more personnel \n6.  Punch out of one Vehicle or Boat (will always be with a person)\n7. Disallow entry to personnel or vehicle if they have not yet punched out. First punch in, then punch out, then punch in. \n\n### Manage Entities\n> Create, Read, Update, Delete, and List view with basic search of all listed entities\n1. User\n2. Person\n3. Vehicle (Car, Bike, or Boat are types of Vehicle)\n4. Invitation\n5. Pass\n6. Entry\n7. Gate\n8. File\n9. Rejection Reason\n10. Department (to track who belongs to RPs)\n11. Personnel Categories (including time frames per day per category)\n\n### Additional Features\n1. Per entity audit logs\n2. Login with Microsoft\n\n## Architecture\n- Database: PostgreSQL 15\n- Backend: .NET 7 Web API\n- Web Frontend: Vue 3 \n- Expected Host: Ubuntu 22.04, with support for Docker  \n- 2 Environments: 1 Live, 1 Staging\n- Sendgrid over O365 for emails\n\n## Required from MMH\n1. Access to Sharepoint Lists\n2. Exports of reports from current PowerBI System \n3. Form information collected for personnel, vehicle or boat\n4. Email address from where site shall be accessed\n5.

                "text": "Hey Gilbert \n\nBelow find a bit of a breakdown of how we have worked with Miles so far. I have written it in the third person so that it's clear to anyone reading it who the relevant parties are. \n\nPrior to digging into the individual causes for the total value of the invoices, I think it's important to quickly go over the terms of  the agreement between MilesXP and Pretty Neat. We were approached to quote for a system against a set of specifications provided by Gilbert. At the time of quoting, the specifications were very detailed in some areas (ex. Customer, Bookings, Quotations), and somewhat high level in others (ex. Driver). \n\nWe provided an estimate of 48K which had with it 3 compensation options:\n1. Paid in advance, 100 hours at a time - with justification of each batch of 100 hours to be consumed prior to issuing.  \n2. Billed hourly for time and materials (allowing for changes in requirements).\n3. Fixed bid, with an additional 30% contingency over and above the 48K - paid in 3 instalments (upon commencement, upon delivery, upon completing of testing) and disallowing for changes in requirements.\n\nMilesXP signed off on approach 2, wherein we would bill for any time spent working on this project on a pro-rata basis. We have been working using this approach for 2.5 years. Last year was the first instance of very delayed payments from Miles' end (> 90 days credit). Following some chasing by the Inspectra Finance department, all dues were ultimately settled. This has happened again this year, however no-one is responding to the Finance department's calls for payment. In light of this, initially verbally during a meeting in August with Pierguido, and subsequently both in person and in writing 2 weeks ago to David and Pierguido - I reminded Miles XP of their payment obligations and made it clear that we will not be able to keep working the way we presently as of next quarter - without payments being settled, or a mutually agreed upon way-forward at the very least.\n\nFollowing this, an investigation into the invoices issued (over 6 months ago) begun from Miles' end - leading to their confusion regarding what was part of the original specifications and what wasn't. At a high level (as I explained to David and Pierguido in person 2 weeks ago) this can be broken down into 3 categories of expenses. \n\n1. Core Requirements\nWe initially estimated 48K for these core requirements. Due to relatively minor changes throughout the course of the development, the final costs thus far for the Core requirements are at 54K - reflecting a 13% increase over the initial estimate. We received the detailed flow diagrams for this solution (12/12/2021) after the contract with Miles had been signed (24/08/2021). We would not have accepted this had we not agreed to work on a Time and Materials basis (as changes in requirements would not be permitted for fixed-bid contracts).   \nFor other projects, when all requirements are set in stone and we are working on a fixed bid, we take a contingency of 30% for any unknown unknowns encountered during development. In this case, the requirements actually changed - aside from the plethora of unknown unknowns encountered on a project of this scale - and we are still just 13% off the mark as of September 2023 (despite Phase 1 of the project running 1.5 years longer than planned). \n\n2. Infrastructure Requirements (Development, Staging and Production)\nAt the time of the quotation being accepted, no information was provided about working with a 3rd party who would be handling the infrastructure, nor was there any information that there would be an automated development, staging and production environment which we would not be able to manage and monitor directly - nor that we would be guiding and assisting the third party (ie not just doing it ourselves) as to how to host our Dotnet and Vue applications. The tooling used by 56Bit is not the tooling we are accustomed to - so a non-trivial amount of time was spent adapting it to their processes. This is not to say that 56Bit have not done a good job of their work - it is only to emphasize that we are just billing for these requests as we receive them as we never accounted for them in our initial estimate. I have gone ahead and attached the requirements document provided by 56Bit - to provide a bit of context onto how much technical complexity there is, and how many different AWS services are involved. This unfortunately, was not a simple matter of tossing our code over the wall and letting the other guys handle it - and alot more like changing the foundation of a building while trying to renovate it's insides. \n\n3. Driver App Requirements\nThe only Driver related element that we quoted for was the ability for users' to be classified as a driver and to log the status changes associated with a booking done by the driver.  This was 1 page in the 43 page requirements document that we quoted against.  The first formal driver-specific requirements document was received on the 18/01/2022 (document attached) delineated what was our responsibility and what was Rubber Duck's. Everything marked in blue was assumed to be Rubber Duck's responsibility (as per the mail cited below) This did not turn out to be accurate as we ended up building all the API for each of the items that Rubber Duck built a frontend for. \n\t> \"As per our conversation, please find RFP with a text mark in blue which would need to be developed by Rubber Duck while all other unmarked text will be handled by the API except for the front-end development which you would still need to handle.\"\n\nIn the case of both 56Bit and Rubber Duck, we were instructed to support them as needed - and more recently, we were instructed to note the time spent supporting both companies as separate line items. This has been present in every monthly invoice as from at least February this year. In fact, they are the only line items appearing in all of the outstanding dues owed to Pretty Neat. Attached find an Excel file detailing where time was spent (beyond the original requirements). \n\nIf there is a problem with the current approach and Miles would prefer to work on a pay-in-advance basis or to re-quote prior to commencing any changes, then it is absolutely not a problem for us. Ultimately we are flexible and will work with whatever process or pace the client prefers.  \n\nThat said, all outstanding and overdue bills must be settled - and the quantities billed are not up for negotiation. This is effort and wages that have already been spent, and the period for contesting such invoices having long past as per the terms stated in the contract and invoices. We have not exercised our right to halt further works or charge interest as of yet - nor do we want to. The MilesXP operational staff and the team of contractors assembled really is an excellent collection of people - and ultimately we want this project to succeed and for both business to continue collaborating in the long term. \n\nUltimately, I think this failure in process comes down to the following:\n1. An incorrect assumption by Gilbert (due to a failure in communication by Miles team) that we were working against a fixed bid.\n2. A failure to process invoices issued by Pretty Neat in a timely manner.\n3. Pretty Neat not insisting _formally_ on being paid sooner. We did this verbally during meetings and via our finance department - but evidently not enough directly to the Miles administration team in writing. This would have allowed for more run-way to allow Miles to investigate their billing issues before having to halt services.\n\nHopefully this clears up our position, and makes clear what assumptions we have been operating under. \n\nKind Regards\n\n",

Please do not change the order of the issue sections without prior discussion. The intent is to roll out changes as each section is complete, to not overwhelm users and to ensure that we are adding value as quickly as possible.  \n\n#### 1. General\n- [ ] Toggle between Estimate and Quotation \n\t- [ ] Page and printout text should toggle between 'Quotation' and 'Estimate'\n\t- [ ] Copywriting for the printout Terms of Service will be different. For now use placeholder text 'An Estimate subject to change pending further investigation by the technicians or more information from the client.'\n- [ ] Move Quotation VAT Exempt toggle to top of page\n- [ ] Add Date of Issue as an editable field. It should default to the current day. \n- [ ] Search by one or more properties not across whole row (including search by Serial Number, Client Identifier Code, Equipment Type, Client ID) for Quotations table. \n- [ ] Quotations can have information appended to them over time, and the prices can be modified. \n- [ ] Price information needs to be hidden for Technicians, and visible to MCSU Sales and MCSU Management - configurable via Access Control.\n- [ ] Publish Changes.\n\n#### 2. Quotation Items\n- [ ] Details page (pricing information only available to specific users) showing Quotation Item, related Equipment Type information, and related Equipment Information. \n  - [ ] This page should be accessible via link in the Quotation Item summary and should open as a new tab. \n  - [ ] A percentage difference in price with default equipment type method's price and the quotation item price should also be displayed on the page. \n  - [ ] Display a list of other quotations where this item is present, with links to open said quotations.\n- [ ] Add Quotation Item to be displayed as a modal not inline, allowing for the input of the following besides the existing values: Client Identifier (not yet in DB), Description,  Range, Tolerance and Frequency. These properties are associated with the individual piece of equipment not the method or equipment type. \n- [ ] Serial Number **OR** Client Identifier are mandatory. Serial number is the manufacturer issued identifier code.  Client Identifier is the supplier provided inventory code provided. They have the same uniqueness constraints based on Client + Equipment Type. \n- [ ] Add an info icon to the inline summary of the quotation item. When hovered, display a tooltip with the information present in the modal, along with a percentage difference in price vs the default price for the method in use.\n\n### 3. Equipment Types\n- [ ] Index page must include quantity of methods and price range (ex. 10-250€). These columns should only be visible to specific users. \n- [ ] Publish Changes.\n \n### 4. Services\n> - Describes a repeatable service that MCSU can offer which is not associated with a specific kind of equipment (ex. On-Site Inspection). \n> - A service has a unit of measure (ex. Hours), quantity, description, title, created by/at, and updated by/at. New services cannot be created on the fly at the quotations page - they must be created via the Services CRUD pages. \n- [ ] Index Page (include all properties listed above, search title and name)\n- [ ] Create/Edit Page (pricing information only available to specific users)\n- [ ] Section underneath Quotation Items. Adding a new row can be done inline.  \n\n### 5. Additional Charges\n> - Describes a one-off service that MCSU can offer. \n> - Can be associated with an equipment (ex. outsourcing), another Service (ex. repair of broken item in cleanroom) or not be associated with anything (ex. site evaluation)\n- [ ] Index Page (include all properties listed above, search title and name)\n- [ ] Details page (pricing information only available to specific users) - no create or edit.\n- [ ] Section underneath Additional Expenses. Adding a new row can be done inline. \n- [ ] Publish Changes.\n\n### Equipment\n- [ ] View calibration history (derived from past calibrations of that specific equipment) and client information directly inside of Equipment Details page (most important value is Date of Last Calibration)\n\n### Lab Equipment\n> - MCSU Owned Equipment. This should be its own module. \n> - All fields that are present in the regular Equipment module should be present here except for Client; And it should also include Date Calibrated and Calibrated By (freetext for name of third party vendor).\n- [ ] View calibration history (derived from past calibrations of that specific equipment) and Date of Last Calibration,  Calibrated By and any other columns present in (X:\\MCSU\\MCSU_QMS\\MCSU Records\\MCSU Equipment\\List of Equipment)\n- [ ] Index Page \n- [ ] Create/Edit Page\n- [ ] Publish Changes\n\n### QoL Improvements to all MCSU Modules\n- [ ] Include help button adjacent to each Module title (ex. Additional Expenses - Describes a one-off service that MCSU can offer. Can be associated with an equipment, another Service or not be associated with anything.)\n\n### Services\n- [ ] A service (ex. Mapping Cleanroom A) can have multiple activities. Each activity (ex. check filters, check AC) can have a quantity. A service has a single price (not per activity). \n\n### Quotations\n- [ ] Can add the same equipment multiple times in the same quotation, so long as the methods are different. (ex. Thermohydrometer - humidity and temperature test). \n- [ ] Pricing information can be hidden on a per-line basis. A hide/show all button should be made available. The total price of the quotation can never be hidden. \n- [ ] Pricing information grouped by Equipment can optionally be toggled on and off. \n\n### Equipment Type Methods\n- [ ] Equipment types can have a static number of points, or dynamic number of points. If it is static, then it should function how it has been. If it is dynamic, a Quantity field is displayed beside the quotation items wherein the price displayed is multiplied by the quantity specified, and the quantity is displayed on the quotation. \n- [ ] Equipment Type methods can have Internal Notes appended to them that do not show in the quotation\n\n### Additional Charges\n- [ ] Can be one-off (by default) or recurring\n- [ ] Recurring ACs will be available using autocomplete within the quotation items. They can only be created via the AC module. \n- [ ] One-Off ACs can be created directly within a quotation, but these will not be used for other quotation items. They will be purely one-off \n- [ ] \n",

When did Jamaica state she would prefer part-time work?\n9. Why didn't we terminate her when she was unable to do shift work? (Baby)\n10. Why didn't we switch her employment to part-time with Jobs Plus once she started requesting less work? (Deportation)\n11. Why did we inform her she has to pay a fine if she leaves? (Definite Contract, GMP Training)\n12. Why wasn't her wage issued via bank transfer like the rest of her payslips? (She needed incentive to come speak with us as she had absconded) \n13. Why didn't you fire her when she wasn't clocking enough hours or unable to do shift work?

Once RPs review it, then it can be sold as per GDP (Good Distribution Practice). 3 tiers of checks - stores check goods vs data, then import. Then it is double checked by RPs to make sure papers and data in SIMS matches. \nCurrently paper based due to convention and training of stores team.\nAdjustments and corrections are handled by RPs - \nPurchasing Officer (Sergio) based on invoice \nProduct Release Checklist \nPFile includes temperature data - which some MAHs are requesting are forwarded. Very much at the mercy of their suppliers. \nMedical Devices have a huge number of SKUs -> \nRare Diseases + Oncology Treatment - JIT is essential for some products (as people die alot). Things are urgent more. \nTenders create ad-hoc requests which create inconsistent timeframes.\nMedical Devices are being batched but not as much as desired.\nRitienne been here 5 years. \nHeadcount\nSOPs, documents, versioning is managed 100% over email. \nOnly Quality Training (Pharmacovigilence, Temperature Monitoring - basically training on how to use the system ) is handled on RPs (\n - Fully paper based QMS (for distribution). \n - Quarterly training \n\nTrackers \n Also handles audits and tracking of audits\n Functions as the whip for \n Trackers are always constant - with periodic minor amendments\n Triggers should be sent automatically to the relevant \n Forms \n  \n \n\n- Main Warehouse (First Quarantine, then Market)\n- Centralization Warehouse (Remedies) Stores also responsible for uploading to SIMS - as this is coming from a local agent who already does a bunch of checks. \n- Majority of training is PDFs \n- Induction and Annual Training is regularly scheduled\n- SOPs are documented using Word and saved to PDF.\n- Induction Training (should be handled by HR). \n- RPs are being used for authoring not just maintaining. They believe they are overloaded. Typically the strategy is to replicate MAH's guides.  \n- As individuals they are liable \n- VeevaVault \n- SAP Success Factor \n- Training should \n- Calendars are not really used \n- IT training \n- Stores, maintenance not everyone has emails or accounts. \n- Invoice + Supplier approval process - Centralized document signing\n- Thorough testing phase for any software \n- Department has quite high turnover \n- \n\n## Qs\nCost of failure, why paper?\n\nNext Session\n- Trackers for Training (tracking assessment) \n- Shadowing of compiliation of P-File for Medical Device and Pharmaceutical\n\nEsther Zammit - Medical Device Registered Person\nYasmin Caruana - Responsible Person \nVladimir Mifsud - Administration Officer\nRitienne - Head of RP Department (Regulatory / Compliance / Quality / RPs)2\n\nEach department head is responsible for their own training. \n\n### Trackers for Training\n> Depends on other departments, thus is a PITA. \n> Reports for training outputs. \n- Excel everything\n- Full list of SOP training based on level (only for AM Mangion Limited - not Remedies or any other deptartment)\n- Levels reflect the expectations of the departments within the quality system. RP Office are level 4, C-Level,  Management, Medical Reps, Finance are Level 3, Technical staff are level 2, Non-technical staff are level 1\n- Includes SOP Version, Effective Date (meaning date of which the SOP should come into effect - 2 weeks after creation), Date of Compilation, IsAssigned (true/false), \n- Older versions are stored as files but are not referenced in the Excel\n- Controlled document are sometimes included here if it requires training (controlled document is a form). Policies are managed through here.  \n- Main function of AMM Mangion Limited is distribution - Level is allocated based on impact of distribution. \n- Training provided sometimes informally, or via Powerpoint, or by the supervisors/managers directly\n- New SOP gets sent to Vladimir, and he checks the individuals who should be receiving the training, and he issues an email notice. \n- If staff that require training do not have an email address (ex. Stores, Maintenance), then a Training Record Form is used to track that the staff received the training. This is not tracked via the sheet, its department knowledge. \n- Service Suppliers can also be trained (Requalification), but they are not tracked in the sheet. \n- Training emails are routinely ignored. \n- Training emails include the revisions to the document, the amendments to the title. Who should be trained \n- Managed by Vladimir\n- Levels is a kind of grouping, and there are additional inter-department groupings, but chasing per group rather than per individual is not really viable for most departments (exceptions: finance, stores)\n- RPs manage\n\t- All SOPs \n\t- All Controlled Documents\n\t- Quality Policy (not all policies) \n\t- Induction Training (1-1), These ought to be batched, however theres no grouping yet - its all done adhoc. \n\t- Annual Training (3-1, sometimes online); Includes an assessment (done as a group); Incentives point RPs to make sure everyone passes (frustrated RPs are frustrated); Copies of assessment are kept indefinitely as they are always physical copies. \n- RPs do not manage\n\t- Other companies\n\t- On the job training\n\t- Department Policies\n- Training is viewed as an unnecessary process. Never any repercussions that training is not being done. Lack of accountability. Growing problem of potential liabilities due to increase in company size. \n- SOPs are always PDF. \n- Internal process maintenance \n- The quality of the RP department will improve\n- Less things falling through the cracks \n- Lack of KPIs around training success for other departments\n- Atm the RPs do not have any fire-power within the organisation. \n  \n### Tracker Maintenance and Validation Plan \n> Validation & Maintenance Tracking Sheet\n- Currently lacking monitoring them \n- Maintenance of Facilities, Temperature tracking, Vehicles, \n- What is being maintained, How you do it, desired frequency, date last conducted, next due date (derived from frequency) and actioned by (ex. Stores Personell) \n- Within the RP team, everyone in RP dept person responsible for this document\n- Reviewed once or twice a month \n- Currently does not keep track of which SOP requires said validation/maintenance. \n- Currently does not track what is explicitly a legal requirement \n- Periodic reminders are not being issued at the moment\n- Emails or in person are by far the most common forms of following up\n\n### Tracker of PFiles\n> Medical Devices P-File Tracker_Medical Devices.xlsx. This is purely for internal use. \n> Ritianne and Yasmin handles Medicines. P-File Tracker_Medicines.xlsx.\n> Cosmetics and other items do not pass through the RPs. \n1. Consignment sent to the stores, and its received\n2. Purchasing officer compares the items between the Invoice (on Shireburn) and goods received form and resolves any issues (excluding damages) and notes the discrepancies. \n3. These invoices are then made visible in Quarantine location (on Shireburn) - prior to delivery they are tracked externally. \n4. Once all the documents are compiled brought up to Esther for her to begin the release process. \n5. MDD (Medical Device Directive) is the old legislation / compliance process only for items for 'old' items. \n6. MDR (Medical Device Regulation) is the new regulations and is more stringent (ie.  everything needs a UDI - unique device identifier - but is actually per batch). \n7. Release process dictated by from where the item was sourced (ie. as Distributer - within EU, or Importer - outside EU) - and the associated checklist.\n8. When importing the item needs to be labelled as imported by AMM, amongst other processes.\n9. In the event of temperature or logistic failures, then Esther investigates it by querying the supplier or rep. \n10. When it passes release, then via Shireburn the item is moved to LUQA from QUARANTINE and then sends an email to the Ray, Purchasing Officer, Tenders and store keepers. \n11. When the store keepers recieve this, then it is moved to a new store location. \n12. It can then be sold or distributed.\n13. The hardcopies are then filed and signed, and they are provided to the Supply Chain team (depending on the item it will go to Shipping Officer or Tenders Officer). After this, it is sent to Accounts department for processing and ultimately archiving. \n14. All checks need to be carried out on each line item in the consignment. One line item must always refer to the same SKU/Batch/UDI - however may refer to multiple items. Each line item gets its own checklist. MDR or MDD requirements are per line item, not per consignment. \n15. Medical Reps are there to harass the suppliers into providing the required documentation that is specified on the checklist. In some cases, these are stored in Sharepoint, sometimes directly in the I Drive, other times via Email. \n16. Tracking of the validity of these documents cannot be done in automated fashion atm. It is done on a per-Medical Rep basis, in the format negotiated between the Supplier, Esther, and the Rep. RPs do not have the ability to impose requirements on the Medical Reps. Management's direction is that preparing these documents to facilitate the RP Depts job and ensure the validity of the documents is an *optional* responsibility of the Medical Rep (TBI further why this is optional).\n17. Ask HR for who the Medical Reps report to - Bernice Rizzo is in charge of HR.\n\n\n### NEXT\n- Bernice\n- Roberto\n- Liz\n\n### Pending Pain Points\n- Document management system \n",

These invoices are then made visible in Quarantine location (on Shireburn) - prior to delivery they are tracked externally. \n4. Once all the documents are compiled brought up to Esther for her to begin the release process. \n5. MDD (Medical Device Directive) is the old legislation / compliance process only for items for 'old' items. \n6. MDR (Medical Device Regulation) is the new regulations and is more stringent (ie.  everything needs a UDI - unique device identifier - but is actually per batch). \n7. Release process dictated by from where the item was sourced (ie. as Distributer - within EU, or Importer - outside EU) - and the associated checklist.\n8. When importing the item needs to be labelled as imported by AMM, amongst other processes.\n9. In the event of temperature or logistic failures, then Esther investigates it by querying the supplier or rep. \n10. When it passes release, then via Shireburn the item is moved to LUQA from QUARANTINE and then sends an email to the Ray, Purchasing Officer, Tenders and store keepers. \n11. When the store keepers recieve this, then it is moved to a new store location. \n12. It can then be sold or distributed.\n13. The hardcopies are then filed and signed, and they are provided to the Supply Chain team (depending on the item it will go to Shipping Officer or Tenders Officer). After this, it is sent to Accounts department for processing and ultimately archiving. \n14. All checks need to be carried out on each line item in the consignment. One line item must always refer to the same SKU/Batch/UDI - however may refer to multiple items. Each line item gets its own checklist. MDR or MDD requirements are per line item, not per consignment. \n15. Medical Reps are there to harass the suppliers into providing the required documentation that is specified on the checklist. In some cases, these are stored in Sharepoint, sometimes directly in the I Drive, other times via Email. \n16. Tracking of the validity of these documents cannot be done in automated fashion atm. It is done on a per-Medical Rep basis, in the format negotiated between the Supplier, Esther, and the Rep. RPs do not have the ability to impose requirements on the Medical Reps. Management's direction is that preparing these documents to facilitate the RP Depts job and ensure the validity of the documents is an *optional* responsibility of the Medical Rep (TBI further why this is optional).\n17.

Each row then needs actioning. \n\t- Include date of negative stock with this report \n- Identify 'Super Spreaders' - Get negative stocks, get sales made by users who have made transactions immediately after a zero stock \n- Transfers from one pharmacy to another lead to a separate space of problems \n- Transfers also done ad-hoc \n- Pharmacists reuse credentials of one another due to the Locum pharmacist schedule\n\t- Locums are sometimes left alone (ex Saturday) \n\t- Rarely shared across pharmacies, but happens sometimes \n\t- Identify cost of user accounts? (CHRIS SHIRFIELD) \n\t- Identify suspicions largest contributors (LIZ) \n\t- Adjust frequency of negative stock checks?\n- Biggest offender Siggiewi due to \n\t- bursts of traffic\n\t- changes in hands (invoice done by A, sale by B, data entry by C) \n- Assist with labour / process - orient finance around difficult pharmacies intermittently \n- Commission structure is not per agent, its per team \n- Stock take coupled with Accounts person atm - may not be necessary (potentially compounding issues ex. clashing with pharmacy's internal stock management; Makes it far hastier than is ideal; Actually compounds the negative stock problem) \n- Bring barcode printer for old stock (especially for Make up)\n- Naming conventions for 'difficult' stock with single sales - Gloves, Syringes, Masks,  (Manufacturer-Uom-Needle/No Needle-Index: ex PIC2.5N01,  APP21N01)\n- Better Dashboard for Finance\n\t- Changes in sale price\n\t- Stock codes created recently \n\t- Transfers made \n\t- Items Pending Verifications (or Input)\n\n### How does Hamrun avoid this problem?\n- Resist urgency promises with customers\n- Data entry same day, same person\n- Regular maintenance (ie reviewing of negative stocks) / stock take frequency\n- Commissions structure? \n- Human error is the problem; The time to resolution is too long, such that a human resolution is a compounding archeology exercise; Solution may involve removing finance bottleneck, improving their visibility, to allow for pharmacies to correct own issues;\n\n### What happens elsewhere?\n### What reports / data does Liz need to assist with enforcement\nLooking like Pharmacy Administration Tool is required. \n - Training Module + Centralized Communication  Pilot Project for\n   Pharmacy Watchtower\n\n\n## FRANCESCA Managing pharmacists at Campus Hub \n_ Robot helping alot \n- Wrong item is scanned at the sales point (ie same item scanned twice, instead of 2 distinct products)\n\t- Images as part \n\t- are they the same user?\n\t- wrong punch? \n- When a good needs to be sold urgently, cash is put aside, date on bag, and transaction effected at a later date. (once every 4 3-4 months) \n- Same item under a different stock code, when its meant to be an additional barcode\n- Claim that there are discrepancies between data saved/moved by stores  (or possibly accounts? (ex. Movicol)\n- Items coming from the Central Stores are not always input prior to delivery. \n- Weekly stock takes \n- Accounts aggrevate the stock taking process  (ideally sales assistance) (takes place 2 years) \n- Stock adjustments done manually and highlighted (no standard process across pharmacies; mostly stock movements); This is the primary cause, however identifying the culprits is difficult as requires checking the journal. \n\nSIMS\nInclude Sales Person in Stock Transaction (without digging into sales orders) \n\n \n\n\n",

Each row then needs actioning. \n\t- Include date of negative stock with this report \n- Identify 'Super Spreaders' - Get negative stocks, get sales made by users who have made transactions immediately after a zero stock \n- Transfers from one pharmacy to another lead to a separate space of problems \n- Transfers also done ad-hoc \n- Pharmacists reuse credentials of one another due to the Locum pharmacist schedule\n\t- Locums are sometimes left alone (ex Saturday) \n\t- Rarely shared across pharmacies, but happens sometimes \n\t- Identify cost of user accounts? (CHRIS SHIRFIELD) \n\t- Identify suspicions largest contributors (LIZ) \n\t- Adjust frequency of negative stock checks?\n- Biggest offender Siggiewi due to \n\t- bursts of traffic\n\t- changes in hands (invoice done by A, sale by B, data entry by C) \n- Assist with labour / process - orient finance around difficult pharmacies intermittently \n- Commission structure is not per agent, its per team \n- Stock take coupled with Accounts person atm - may not be necessary (potentially compounding issues ex. clashing with pharmacy's internal stock management; Makes it far hastier than is ideal; Actually compounds the negative stock problem) \n- Bring barcode printer for old stock (especially for Make up)\n- Naming conventions for 'difficult' stock with single sales - Gloves, Syringes, Masks,  (Manufacturer-Uom-Needle/No Needle-Index: ex PIC2.5N01,  APP21N01)\n- Better Dashboard for Finance\n\t- Changes in sale price\n\t- Stock codes created recently \n\t- Transfers made \n\t- Items Pending Verifications (or Input)\n\n### How does Hamrun avoid this problem?\n- Resist urgency promises with customers\n- Data entry same day, same person\n- Regular maintenance (ie reviewing of negative stocks) / stock take frequency\n- Commissions structure? \n- Human error is the problem; The time to resolution is too long, such that a human resolution is a compounding archeology exercise; Solution may involve removing finance bottleneck, improving their visibility, to allow for pharmacies to correct own issues;\n\n### What happens elsewhere?\n### What reports / data does Liz need to assist with enforcement\nLooking like Pharmacy Administration Tool is required. \n - Training Module + Centralized Communication  Pilot Project for\n   Pharmacy Watchtower\n\n\n## FRANCESCA Managing pharmacists at Campus Hub \n_ Robot helping alot \n- Wrong item is scanned at the sales point (ie same item scanned twice, instead of 2 distinct products)\n\t- Images as part \n\t- are they the same user?\n\t- wrong punch? \n- When a good needs to be sold urgently, cash is put aside, date on bag, and transaction effected at a later date. (once every 4 3-4 months) \n- Same item under a different stock code, when its meant to be an additional barcode\n- Claim that there are discrepancies between data saved/moved by stores  (or possibly accounts? (ex. Movicol)\n- Items coming from the Central Stores are not always input prior to delivery. \n- Weekly stock takes \n- Accounts aggrevate the stock taking process  (ideally sales assistance) (takes place 2 years) \n- Stock adjustments done manually and highlighted (no standard process across pharmacies; mostly stock movements); This is the primary cause, however identifying the culprits is difficult as requires checking the journal. \n\nSIMS\nInclude Sales Person in Stock Transaction (without digging into sales orders) \n\n \n\n\n",

        "text": "PrettyNeat 2024, i.e. the meeting we missed:**\n\n1. *Main plans (if any) for 2024, given the benefit of 3 months in. From my POV, we are ~ moving along with a number of projects in parallel, capitalizing on where client needs can push dev (see TIM / PunchIM, Odoo etc). I do not know if this aligns with some longer term/higher level discourse or (as it feels) it’s about catching opportunities as we go (not inherently bad, mind you). Though, can’t visualize any sort of additional planning on top of it.*\n\nThe plan is fairly simple - Pursue recurring revenue, and onboard multi-year client contracts. For the former we are expanding the quantity of Odoo deployments, prioritising PunchIM for high volume low-skill staff, and trying to commercialise the Gate Security system. For the latter we are pursuing AM Mangion (Pharmaceuticals), MMH (Maritime) and Inspectra (Manufacturing) as PN will be its own company before year's end. Ultimately I want us to get to a place where the recurring revenue is paying our salaries, and the client work is giving us runway for more products. While we are trending this way, at present, the inverse is true - and will likely remain true for the next 2-3 years. \n\n2. *Plans for training/internal upskilling/internal dev; I told HR (during their interview thingie) that I would love to get any kind of training (the feeling of heavily falling behind, closing myself off with siloed knowledge is growing ever stronger). At the same time, “it’s what we need now” and I can’t be the one who goes on a tangent to build/break/fail something. My feeling is the above applies: if the right opportunity comes, we can expand someone’s (and the company’s) “horizon” (see Hristo/MAUI). There seems to be no space for structured training/learning/experimentation.*\n\nI am operating under the assumption that you are interested in growing as an individual contributor, not in a managerial role - meaning that training or upskilling of any sort would be technical in nature. Is there a javascript, MAUI, postgresql, authentication or other course topic that is adjacent to our current work that you are interested in pursuing? Is my assumption incorrect, and you're interested in more soft-skill/leadership sorts of training?\n\nI would be happy to subsidise training if this is something you'd like to pursue and contributes towards our current trajectory. The biggest issue I have is that unlike the other members of our team, you do not have any free time outside of work for pursuing training. Therefore the maximum length of any training really can't take longer than a week without having a significant impact on the business. \n\n3. *Open source, content, social capital (or not). Latching into the above, Open Source and social contributions are not in the landscape. Content strategies have build-ups to pay off, which we clearly can’t do (no consistent resources, no obvious ROI, no interest from most of the team). Doesn’t look like this is going anywhere, at least this year.*\n\nWhen we need changes integrated into the libraries we are using, we should upstream them. We have not had this happen since NPoco. I do not see us our stance towards contributing to third party projects changing in the near term. I would very much like to open source some of our javascript libraries (ex. ABTable), however the code quality is not really where it needs to be as of yet. \n\nFor TrackingIM, I would love to adopt an open-core model for the entire system - but the only way I see that happening is if the ancillary products (ex. PIM, CIM) are generating enough revenue to facilitate that (note: its nowhere near this point yet) and/or we have enough non-technical customers for TIM that the project is financing its self already (and we're not at risk of FOSS forks subverting business from TIM). My position on this is quite loose honestly - and I'm open to being convinced otherwise. It is all very secondary to monetising TIM/PIM locally at present. \n\nAt present, the content we are capable of writing well will help with recruitment - but not attracting new customers. We are not in a recruitment mode at the moment, and so content writing has been deprioritised. \n\nTLDR I agree, this is not a priority this year (so far at least). If we wish to flex these muscles, at best we can make our internal/client facing documentation more consumable for a wider audience and upload this content to our blog.\n\n*Ops: Pull Requests/Reviews (what we are doing, what to do more/better/else). Main issue here is that there is not only no guides, but also no actual, properly working example, resulting in Great Confusion. As a result, the process feels kinda “useless”: either we rush through it given the lack of mapped environments and rules, the need to update a certain ENV, or we kinda wave it off because no time or procedure are present for the Review. So great idea BUT inconvenient roadblock as of now.*\n\nPlease document your suggested process in under 500 words. Please treat this as lower priority than MCSU and TIM requests - however feel free to carve 1/2 day out of the next 10 working days to carry this exercise out. My suggestion is to put it in the calendar so we (Hristo and I) work around your allocated day. \n\n*Moving code review to the Sitting Stand Up format. Would love to have some “mental flowchart” on how to pick presentables, so that a) I don’t get stuck on this and b) when other do, I can guide them (operating on the assumption of your absence). Aside from this. it’s an evolving format, so we need to keep it up and see where it goes.*\n\nI don't know what you mean by this. Following your proposal for Pull Request process, I will ask for some clarifications on this. \n\n*When Are We Killing INS-APP01 And Formalizing The PN-APP01 Thing. This requires time and planning, which are both relatively scarce as of now. We may also decide not to plan it at all and simply slowly migrate organically, which I predict will spill over to 2025 (which is not bad in itself - just a ballpark figure).* \n\nIf memory serves me well, removing NGINX is the only thing that needs actual work. I will move external 80/443 requests to point to PN-APP01 - and we copy over the NGINX conf from INS-APP01 as is - modifying only the bits that affect requests to MIS. Am I forgetting something? If not, shall we schedule this for 1st or 2nd week of May? \n\n*Some question marks about Ilya’s operations specifically; I feel the need to understand the reach of my “decisional and operational freedom/authortity” mostly to see how to act when I’m working my usual weird times and to avoid blocking people randomly, which I hate. The key here is having more context on what’s going on, probably.*\n\nI don't know what the question is here. \n\n*About the main projects (MIS/TIM); Comms; Unfortunately we may need to use the GH Projects more; I am trying to use it more and dump the stuff you send me and the stuff I send you into issues and comments.* If it ends being a “place” where there is _generally_​ a project and _digital coordinate_​ to help whenever I feel like there’s a lot of threads - all going nowhere - which is an **increasing**​ state.\n\nMy suggestion would be to create a project board that covers your 'to-do' list. This is what I do. The others are all managing their own to do list in their own manner, and I do not see the need to standardise this at the moment.\n\nTechnical descriptions of the actual bugs or features being requested should live in their respective Issues section. Your to-do list should simply make reference to the issues (not be the actual full description).   \n\n*Planning for Ilya and others is tricky; As I mentioned, probably having a bit of a floating backlog may help when planning goes sideways. Priorities aside, I am usually able to detect roadblocks and move “things being done” accordingly (for myself and eventually others only-if-needed); Being left in a bit of floaty state sucks; May have to do with definition of competencies/responsibilities? Personally - I have an increasing number of “now what”​ moments where I’m doubtful of what comes _right_​ next.\nMay stem from really not being sure about how responsibility is allocated, or which kind of responsibilities exist in the first place (I’m not up to date with “what’s up” at the company in principle, since, well, even this meeting became an email).*\n\nIn a nutshell, you are the \n1. 'Project owner' of the MIS and any requests that come in\n2. Senior Developer / Point of Contact with respect to technical database, auth or backend queries \n3. Informal 'champion' of DevEx (mostly in the form of documentation)\n\n*Standards; Are we doing enough to enforce this; This being GitFlow or whatever but we also may want to approximate how to write, label and address stuff in the projects or, _for the unholy nine hells’ sake_​ at least in the group chats. I’m fine with doing more shit in Teams if that helps everyone gain an understanding which currently I’m not seeing. I’ll actually probably start sending out “Teams surveys” or whatever they’re called every so often (if allowed).*\n\nIf we make Pull Requests mandatory only at the point of merging to develop/stg, then we are deviating from the Pull-Request based versions of Gitflow. I quite like the approach documented below with 2 amendments - no rebases, only merges; PR when bringing code to develop and staging; \n\nhttps://medium.com/goodtogoat/simplified-git-flow-5dc37ba76ea8\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nStill having the odd regression or conflict that should not happen; Branches mismatch and label galore, ties in nicely with the whole PR and other process decisions which are _very good_​ but also kinda lack the necessary surroundings. I’m not going to identify the missing surrounding here because that’s a per-project exercise and, maybe, maybe _the others_​ want to identify what’s missing and give us some insight.\n\n*Is a guide or a meeting or something else needed. My thoughts are guide​ : no and meeting​ : no but not because we don’t need direction. We just need it to come from elsewhere because I feel otherwise it will be a waste of time. So again, probably this needs to be kind of an exercise in “can you describe why is this a mess”. Long term for MIS/NoSheet (as the two top projects here). The long term has been constantly moving around. Do we have one now? Do we even need one? As above, MIS is generally addressing the shortcomings and additional requirements from Inspectra, leveraging that as much/far as possible, as for TIM, there’s a bucket list of WOULD​s that may eventually be filled in where possible time/resource wise (see the full Vue3 migration etc). Other personal and impersonal dilemmas hopefully taking 15mins top\nThis is kinda irrelevant for the scope of this email. Edited two or three times for shortness and clarity. Fingers crossed.*\n\nI think I understand the sentiment - but this is a bit too loose to be translated into actions. Can you sharpen your point here a bit? I think I kindof covered this with my prior points, but maybe I'm misunderstanding? \n\nWe will *always* have more feature ideas and 'woulds' than we have time. If we don't, it means we've fallen out of love with our projects. \n\n\n\n\n",

My feeling is the above applies: if the right opportunity comes, we can expand someone’s (and the company’s) “horizon” (see Hristo/MAUI). There seems to be no space for structured training/learning/experimentation.*\n\nI am operating under the assumption that you are interested in growing as an individual contributor, not in a managerial role - meaning that training or upskilling of any sort would be technical in nature. Is there a javascript, MAUI, postgresql, authentication or other course topic that is adjacent to our current work that you are interested in pursuing? Is my assumption incorrect, and you're interested in more soft-skill/leadership sorts of training?\n\nI would be happy to subsidise training if this is something you'd like to pursue and contributes towards our current trajectory. The biggest issue I have is that unlike the other members of our team, you do not have any free time outside of work for pursuing training. Therefore the maximum length of any training really can't take longer than a week without having a significant impact on the business. \n\n3. *Open source, content, social capital (or not). Latching into the above, Open Source and social contributions are not in the landscape. Content strategies have build-ups to pay off, which we clearly can’t do (no consistent resources, no obvious ROI, no interest from most of the team). Doesn’t look like this is going anywhere, at least this year.*\n\nWhen we need changes integrated into the libraries we are using, we should upstream them. We have not had this happen since NPoco. I do not see us our stance towards contributing to third party projects changing in the near term. I would very much like to open source some of our javascript libraries (ex. ABTable), however the code quality is not really where it needs to be as of yet. \n\nFor TrackingIM, I would love to adopt an open-core model for the entire system - but the only way I see that happening is if the ancillary products (ex. PIM, CIM) are generating enough revenue to facilitate that (note: its nowhere near this point yet) and/or we have enough non-technical customers for TIM that the project is financing its self already (and we're not at risk of FOSS forks subverting business from TIM). My position on this is quite loose honestly - and I'm open to being convinced otherwise. It is all very secondary to monetising TIM/PIM locally at present. \n\nAt present, the content we are capable of writing well will help with recruitment - but not attracting new customers. We are not in a recruitment mode at the moment, and so content writing has been deprioritised. \n\nTLDR I agree, this is not a priority this year (so far at least). If we wish to flex these muscles, at best we can make our internal/client facing documentation more consumable for a wider audience and upload this content to our blog.\n\n*Ops: Pull Requests/Reviews (what we are doing, what to do more/better/else). Main issue here is that there is not only no guides, but also no actual, properly working example, resulting in Great Confusion. As a result, the process feels kinda “useless”: either we rush through it given the lack of mapped environments and rules, the need to update a certain ENV, or we kinda wave it off because no time or procedure are present for the Review. So great idea BUT inconvenient roadblock as of now.*\n\nPlease document your suggested process in under 500 words. Please treat this as lower priority than MCSU and TIM requests - however feel free to carve 1/2 day out of the next 10 working days to carry this exercise out. My suggestion is to put it in the calendar so we (Hristo and I) work around your allocated day. \n\n*Moving code review to the Sitting Stand Up format. Would love to have some “mental flowchart” on how to pick presentables, so that a) I don’t get stuck on this and b) when other do, I can guide them (operating on the assumption of your absence). Aside from this. it’s an evolving format, so we need to keep it up and see where it goes.*\n\nI don't know what you mean by this. Following your proposal for Pull Request process, I will ask for some clarifications on this. \n\n*When Are We Killing INS-APP01 And Formalizing The PN-APP01 Thing. This requires time and planning, which are both relatively scarce as of now. We may also decide not to plan it at all and simply slowly migrate organically, which I predict will spill over to 2025 (which is not bad in itself - just a ballpark figure).* \n\nIf memory serves me well, removing NGINX is the only thing that needs actual work. I will move external 80/443 requests to point to PN-APP01 - and we copy over the NGINX conf from INS-APP01 as is - modifying only the bits that affect requests to MIS. Am I forgetting something? If not, shall we schedule this for 1st or 2nd week of May? \n\n*Some question marks about Ilya’s operations specifically; I feel the need to understand the reach of my “decisional and operational freedom/authortity” mostly to see how to act when I’m working my usual weird times and to avoid blocking people randomly, which I hate. The key here is having more context on what’s going on, probably.*\n\nI don't know what the question is here. \n\n*About the main projects (MIS/TIM); Comms; Unfortunately we may need to use the GH Projects more; I am trying to use it more and dump the stuff you send me and the stuff I send you into issues and comments.* If it ends being a “place” where there is _generally_​ a project and _digital coordinate_​ to help whenever I feel like there’s a lot of threads - all going nowhere - which is an **increasing**​ state.\n\nMy suggestion would be to create a project board that covers your 'to-do' list. This is what I do. The others are all managing their own to do list in their own manner, and I do not see the need to standardise this at the moment.\n\nTechnical descriptions of the actual bugs or features being requested should live in their respective Issues section. Your to-do list should simply make reference to the issues (not be the actual full description).   \n\n*Planning for Ilya and others is tricky; As I mentioned, probably having a bit of a floating backlog may help when planning goes sideways. Priorities aside, I am usually able to detect roadblocks and move “things being done” accordingly (for myself and eventually others only-if-needed); Being left in a bit of floaty state sucks; May have to do with definition of competencies/responsibilities? Personally - I have an increasing number of “now what”​ moments where I’m doubtful of what comes _right_​ next.\nMay stem from really not being sure about how responsibility is allocated, or which kind of responsibilities exist in the first place (I’m not up to date with “what’s up” at the company in principle, since, well, even this meeting became an email).*\n\nIn a nutshell, you are the \n1. 'Project owner' of the MIS and any requests that come in\n2. Senior Developer / Point of Contact with respect to technical database, auth or backend queries \n3. Informal 'champion' of DevEx (mostly in the form of documentation)\n\n*Standards; Are we doing enough to enforce this; This being GitFlow or whatever but we also may want to approximate how to write, label and address stuff in the projects or, _for the unholy nine hells’ sake_​ at least in the group chats. I’m fine with doing more shit in Teams if that helps everyone gain an understanding which currently I’m not seeing. I’ll actually probably start sending out “Teams surveys” or whatever they’re called every so often (if allowed).*\n\nIf we make Pull Requests mandatory only at the point of merging to develop/stg, then we are deviating from the Pull-Request based versions of Gitflow. I quite like the approach documented below with 2 amendments - no rebases, only merges; PR when bringing code to develop and staging; \n\nhttps://medium.com/goodtogoat/simplified-git-flow-5dc37ba76ea8\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nStill having the odd regression or conflict that should not happen; Branches mismatch and label galore, ties in nicely with the whole PR and other process decisions which are _very good_​ but also kinda lack the necessary surroundings. I’m not going to identify the missing surrounding here because that’s a per-project exercise and, maybe, maybe _the others_​ want to identify what’s missing and give us some insight.\n\n*Is a guide or a meeting or something else needed. My thoughts are guide​ : no and meeting​ : no but not because we don’t need direction. We just need it to come from elsewhere because I feel otherwise it will be a waste of time. So again, probably this needs to be kind of an exercise in “can you describe why is this a mess”. Long term for MIS/NoSheet (as the two top projects here). The long term has been constantly moving around. Do we have one now? Do we even need one? As above, MIS is generally addressing the shortcomings and additional requirements from Inspectra, leveraging that as much/far as possible, as for TIM, there’s a bucket list of WOULD​s that may eventually be filled in where possible time/resource wise (see the full Vue3 migration etc). Other personal and impersonal dilemmas hopefully taking 15mins top\nThis is kinda irrelevant for the scope of this email. Edited two or three times for shortness and clarity. Fingers crossed.*\n\nI think I understand the sentiment - but this is a bit too loose to be translated into actions. Can you sharpen your point here a bit? I think I kindof covered this with my prior points, but maybe I'm misunderstanding? \n\nWe will *always* have more feature ideas and 'woulds' than we have time. If we don't, it means we've fallen out of love with our projects. \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "  \n## Company Profile\nInspectra Ltd, based in Malta, offers a range of specialized services across various business verticals:\n\n1.  **Quality Control and Sorting Services**: Inspectra provides extensive third-party quality control and sorting services primarily in Malta, addressing every stage of the manufacturing process to ensure defect-free shipments. Their services include product inspection, sub-assembly, labeling, and packaging, along with reworking returned materials​​.\n    \n2.  **Calibration Services**: Inspectra operates the largest Calibration Laboratory in Malta, offering services to industries, medical fields, and more. They provide calibration for a variety of measurement instruments, including pressure, temperature, and weighing devices, in compliance with ISO17025 standards. They perform most of their calibrations in their lab, though certain items are calibrated on client premises​​.\n    \n3.  **Cleanroom Validation**: They offer ISO-17025 accredited testing and validation for cleanrooms and controlled environments. This service spans several industries like pharmaceuticals, food, and aerospace, ensuring compliance with EU-GMP, ISO-14644, and other standards. Their tests include particle count, airflow, and containment checks​​.\n    \n4.  **Outsourcing and Subcontracting Services**: Inspectra provides subcontracting options where they manage various operational processes for other companies. This includes the ability to take over entire sections of a client's production or quality control processes, allowing companies to focus on their core competencies while Inspectra handles specific operational tasks. \n\nThis service is aimed at improving efficiency and reducing costs for their clients by leveraging Inspectra's expertise and infrastructure​​.These services are provided from their headquarters located at the Marsa Industrial Estate, Marsa MRS3000, Malta. Inspectra's focus across these verticals is on delivering high-quality services designed to improve productivity and reduce operational costs for their clients.\n\n## SWOT Analysis\n### Strengths\n1.  **Wide Range of Accredited Services**: Inspectra is well-equipped with ISO 17025 accreditation in multiple areas including calibration and cleanroom testing, enhancing its credibility and market appeal​​​​​​.\n2.  **Industry Leadership in Malta**: As the largest third-party quality control enterprise and calibration laboratory in Malta, Inspectra holds a significant market position in the region​​​​.\n3.  **Diverse Industrial Applications**: The company offers services that cater to a variety of industries, including pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and food, which diversifies its client base and reduces dependency on a single market sector​​.\n\n### Weaknesses\n1.  **Geographic Concentration**: While being a leader in Malta, the company's heavy concentration in a smaller market may limit its exposure to larger international markets and broader economic opportunities.\n2.  **Complex Service Requirements**: The technical and specialized nature of its services, such as cleanroom validation and precision calibration, requires highly skilled personnel and continuous training, which can be resource-intensive​​​​.\n\n### Opportunities\n1.  **Expansion into New Markets**: There are opportunities for geographic and service expansion, particularly in nearby European countries, which could increase market share and leverage Malta’s strategic location as a gateway between Europe and North Africa.\n2.  **Technological Advancements**: The IT sector and emerging technologies offer growth opportunities, especially since the company is already engaged in modernizing enterprises​​.\n3.  **Increased Demand for Outsourcing**: As companies continue to focus on core competencies, the demand for outsourcing, quality control and calibration services could grow, benefiting Inspectra​​.\n\n### Threats\n1.  **Economic Uncertainty**: Economic downturns can affect manufacturing sectors heavily, potentially reducing the demand for Inspectra's services.\n2.  **Regulatory Changes**: The industries Inspectra serves, such as pharmaceuticals and food, are heavily regulated. Changes in regulations could require adjustments in operations, impacting costs and operations​​.\n3.  **Competition**: The presence of other competitors offering similar services at potentially lower costs or with broader service offerings can pose a threat to Inspectra’s market share.\n\n## Digitisation Objectives\n1.  **Efficiency Improvements**: Digital tools can streamline complex processes, reduce manual handling, and cut down on errors. For Inspectra, which deals with precise calibration and quality control, automating data collection and analysis can significantly enhance operational efficiency.\n    \n2.  **Data Management**: Digitization allows for better data management and analysis capabilities. By digitizing records, Inspectra can improve traceability, quality control, and compliance with industry regulations. This is particularly important in highly regulated industries like pharmaceuticals, where accurate documentation is critical.\n    \n3.  **Scalability**: Digital solutions can scale more easily compared to manual processes. As Inspectra looks to expand its services or enter new markets, digital tools can help manage increased volume without a proportional increase in errors or costs.\n    \n4.  **Customer Satisfaction**: Digital platforms can enhance customer interaction by providing more transparent and quicker service delivery. For instance, online portals for service tracking and results delivery can improve customer experience and engagement.\n    \n6.  **Regulatory Compliance**: Digitization can help ensure compliance with changing regulations by making it easier to update systems and processes when necessary. This is crucial in preventing compliance-related issues and avoiding potential fines.\n    \n7.  **Cost Reduction**: Over time, digitization can lead to cost savings by reducing the need for physical resources, decreasing labour costs through automation, and minimizing the likelihood of costly errors.\n",

At present, personnel and vehicles enter via the same gate, however additional gates will be present in the future. Boats are not admitted at present, but the infrastructure should allow handling of boats. \n\n## User Permissions\n### Administrator (Admin)\n1. Can modify all entities\n2. Can approve or deny anyone\n3. Can generate reports\n4. Has full access\n\n### Security Officer (SO)\n1. Can create visitor passes\n2. Can let people in and out and specify reason\n\n### Responsible Person (RP)\n1. Can create any pass for members of their department\n2. Can modify all entities directly associated with members of their department\n3. Can approve or deny for members of their department\n4. Can be many responsible people within a department\n\n## Core \n### Add New Pass\n> Admin, SO, RP\n1. Select Pass Type (Personnel, Vehicle, Boat)\n2. Select Pass Duration \n\t- Permanent - Pass for employee without an expiration (Admin, RP)\n\t- Pre-Approved -  Fixed period pass (for now or future), collect category, requires photo, auto-expires after fixed period (Admin, RP)\n\t- Visitor - Single day pass (for now or future), collect category, auto-expires at end of specified day (Admin, RP, SO)\n3. Pass category denotes what kind of personnel the pass is for (ex. subcontractor, supplier, employee, freight maintenance, etc...). Each pass category has different date and time restrictions as to when they can access the facilities (ex. Pre-Approved pass for Contractor = Monday - Friday: 9 - 5, Saturday 9 - 12, Sunday none). The date and time restriction are described in the Pass Category, but inherited by every personnel using said Duration and Category combination. (Admin)\n4. Input known personnel information. (Admin, RP, SO)\n5. Multiple passes can be issued to the same person, so long as the active periods for the pass do not overlap. \n6. Vehicle is associated with an entry (entrance or exit), but not a person directly. Multiple people can enter via the same vehicle at the same time. \n7. Token for invitation lasts 1 month and can be cancelled. Additional people can be added via the same token indefinitely. Each person added shows up as their own approval.\n8. Input known personnel information. (Admin, RP, SO)\n9. For Permanent, Pre-Approved or Visitor:  Send invitation link for one or more personnel including user specified pass type, duration, category and reference number. Quantity of people to be input as part of invitationand category. Recipients are to fill in any missing values via a form linked in the email.  Can be one or many users in a single email (ex. MMH invite multiple members of staff from PrettyNeat by sending me the invitation link and I input details for each personnel who needs access). Once form filled in and submitted, MMH are notified via email and within the app - with each individual enlisted having their own approval.  (Admin, RP)\n10. For Visitor Passes: Information can be input with the personnel/vehicle/boat's information input in-person by the visitor with the supervision of the SO. In this case, no invitation email is sent and the information is NOT automatically approved - it still needs manual approval by RP or Admin. The relevant pass PDF and QR Code are sent to the input email address, and can be downloaded and printed manually by the SO. \n11. MMH approve or deny the request, modifying any submitted information as needed. (Admin, RP)\n12. Once approved, the personnel/vehicle/boat's pass is issued in the form of a PDF sent as an attachment via email, including the generated QR Code and the personnel's photograph if any. This can be resent via the administration panel (Admin, RP). The personnel cannot modify their own information after they have submit the form. \n13. If denied, notify the personnel involved with the reason for the denial. \n14. On first use of a pass by the SO, disable submit button until the SO manually ticks the 'Vetted ID Card' button (to verify details of personnel on first use).\n\n### Manage Passes\n> The Admin can carry out all actions. \n> The RP can only view and interact with passes associated with personnel and vehicles assigned to their Team.\n> The SO can only view pass information and create visitor passes.  \n1.  Create (see previous section), Read, Update, Delete, and List view of all Passes with conditional Quick Actions\n2. Display columns\n\t- Pass status\n\t- Personnel, Vehicle, or Boat information\n\t- Last Entry or Exit time\n\t- Expiration Date\n\t- Job (Reference) Number\n\t- Personnel Category (ex. Client, Supplier)\n\t- Pass Type\n\t- Active Hours (today)\n3. Quick Actions (Admin, RP)\n\t- If pending form fill, none.\n\t- If form filled in, enable Respond button. Upon clicking, display a modal for more information and Approve or Deny buttons.\n\t- If approved, Print or Resend (to different address) pass button which will open the PDF Pass in a new tab. \n4. When selecting a single pass\n\t- Display entry logs associated with a pass, including any relevant vehicle info\n\t- Display personnel photo\n\t- Display personnel information\n5. Multi-stage filters - allowing one to filter by one or more columns\n6. Automated notification via email to personnel about \n\t- Single Invitation (with Form)\n\t- Multi-Person Invitation (with Form)\n\t- Approval (with Pass PDF)\n\t- Denial (with reason)\n\n### Manage Entry Logs\n1. View and update functionality for \n2. Entry log reports for: \n\t- Current table view with filters applied\n\t- Personnel punched in but not out\n\t- Vehicles punched in but not out\n\t- Personnel let in outside of their allocated hours\n\t- View list of personnel on-site at the moment (ie not punched out)\n3.  Add an entry to track personnel entry or exit (ie punch in or out)\n4. Track personnel or vehicle entry or exit, and from which gate\n5. Punch out of one or more personnel \n6.  Punch out of one Vehicle or Boat (will always be with a person)\n7. Disallow entry to personnel or vehicle if they have not yet punched out. First punch in, then punch out, then punch in. \n\n### Manage Entities\n> Create, Read, Update, Delete, and List view with basic search of all listed entities\n1. User\n2. Person\n3. Vehicle (Car, Bike, or Boat are types of Vehicle)\n4. Invitation\n5. Pass\n6. Entry\n7. Gate\n8. File\n9. Rejection Reason\n10. Department (to track who belongs to RPs)\n11. Personnel Categories (including time frames per day per category)\n\n### Additional Features\n1. Per entity audit logs\n2. Login with Microsoft\n\n## Architecture\n- Database: PostgreSQL 15\n- Backend: .NET 7 Web API\n- Web Frontend: Vue 3 \n- Expected Host: Ubuntu 22.04, with support for Docker  \n- 2 Environments: 1 Live, 1 Staging\n- Sendgrid over O365 for emails\n\n## Required from MMH\n1. Access to Sharepoint Lists\n2. Exports of reports from current PowerBI System \n3. Form information collected for personnel, vehicle or boat\n4. Email address from where site shall be accessed\n5. URL to be used by staff \n6. List of reasons for Denial\n7. Pass Categories and associated schedule\n8. If denied, notify the personnel involved with the reason for the denial. \n\n\n",

Your time started when you began looking for this duffle bag. \n\n### This is your actual Task\nEach of you must pick up a balloon. You must each wear a complete costume set (a top and a bottom) while making sure your balloon does not touch the floor. You cannot hold the balloon. The balloon cannot be stationary for more than 1 second. If you drop the balloon you must return all of your costume to the duffle bag and start again.

We can only mitigate and respond.\nMitigate\nReduce Human Touch points across all systems\nResponse\nProblem compounds over time\nCannot infinitely increase bottleneck capacity\nBring Solution closer to the Problem\nRetain Visibility reduce busy work\nMulti Phased approach\n",

To the extent that any provisions of this Contract are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provisions will be deleted from this Contract or modified so as to make them enforceable, and the validity and enforceability of the remainder of such provisions and of this Contract will be unaffected.\n    \n4.  **Independent Contractor**  \n    Nothing contained in this Contract shall create an employer and employee relationship, a master and servant relationship, or a principal and agent relationship between CA and CG. CG and CA agree that CA is, and at all times during this Contract shall remain, an independent contractor.\n    \n5.  **Force Majeure**  \n    Neither Party shall be liable for any failure to perform under this Contract when such failure is due to causes beyond that Party’s reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of state or governmental authorities, acts of terrorism, natural catastrophe, fire, storm, flood, earthquakes, accident, and prolonged shortage of energy. In the event of such delay, the date of delivery or time for completion will be extended by a period of time reasonably necessary by both CA and CG. If the delay remains in effect for a period in excess of thirty days, CG may terminate this Contract immediately upon written notice to CA.\n    \n6.  **Entire Contract**  \n    This document and all attached or incorporated documents contain the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes any previous understanding, commitments, or agreements, oral or written. Further, this Contract may not be modified, changed, or otherwise altered in any respect except by a written agreement signed by both Parties.\n",

Antivirus scans were carried out on all devices within the network as a redundant assurance that no users have trojans or viruses which may lead to similar compromises.\n3.

Each customer has their own set of S3 buckets. \n \n### Info\n- Punching in and out is treated equally irrespective of the source app, device, or web (via self-login, or admin)\n- Settings list to be provided by daniel\n- Cron jobs used to poll data from devices every 2 hours (some clients every 20mins - extra cost for this) \n\n#### Servers\n- T2.Medium - 4 shift handle clients + python SDK \n- T2.2xlarge - 35 shift handle clients \n- WINDOWS PENDING\n\n### Recommendations\n- Restructure how image uploads work at the moment \n- Migrate servers (to mitigate intruder risk) \n- Upgrade from Laravel 5.8 to 11 (and PHP versions with them) \n- Finish device helper files to work with Python SDK \n- Post-upgrade, test all features prior to any deployments/migrations\n- Mail automations for exceptions and inactive devices\n\n### Doable (pending estimates)\n- Migrate from S3 to local file system \n\n### To Check\n- Total storage in S3\n\n### To Clarify with Clients\n- Data retention policies\n- Data processor agreements with all clients\n\n### Questions\nMigration duration / process of upgrading versions\nApps that connect to the system \nWhich company is using which app, how many users\nHow many 'surplus' devices are on-hand atm (other suppliers)\nWho are the device suppliers \nBilling Structure for Apps and Devices (varying rates per client ex. firedrill)\n\n### To Schedule\nReview of Play Console \nReview of App Console\nRetrieve copies of codebases and last change requests/bugfixes in last 6 months \nVisit Handle demo \nIntroduction with Dylan + Hourly Rate \nSpeak with Neil for Network Setup \nBilling history for the last 3 months (for stuff related to instances/S3/IAM) (showing calculation for adjustment to be ShiftHandle Only)\n\n### Room for Improvement\n- On the app, location is taken at the point of photo taking, not at cconfirmation. May make sense to time-out the confirmation after X seconds. \n- Finish migration to Python SDK \n",

Could you please prepare an implementation and payment plan based on key milestones? Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could advise us on any potential additional costs related to the server and Odoo.\n\nAs discussed, we would like the project kickoff to occur between the 2nd and 4th of September, with the goal of delivering an MVP by the end of November or earlier.\n\nTo ensure a smooth process, I recommend scheduling a meeting with Rafal and Karishma at your earliest convenience, should you require their input on the implementation plan.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nKris Savona\n\n----\n\n16-09-24\n\nHi  Kris,\n\nAs  Kris  had advised, please find below my updates:\n\n1.  The expenses app that you advised to check, works only for employees and not for third-party vendors. So I would like that the vendor bills be qualified under direct and indirect expenses.\n2.  We cannot use the same email address for two persons. (referring to our conversation that I would like my team to be notified altogether when an activity is set for the finance team).\n3.  Anyone can reopen the period of a closed Financial year, I would like to set some approval status to be able to reopen it.\n4.  Prepayments/prepaid income when extracted as a report, does not show products and vendor or customer names. I would like that the products and names appear on the reports.\n5.  Set up a pop-up when opening Odoo for task deadline\n6.  Customisation of certain reports\n7.  Fixed Asset/Depreciation Schedule\n8.  How to upload the commissions excel on Odoo\n9.  You were supposed to send some tutorials for Management Accounts\n\n**Karishma Abeeluck**  \n\n----\n\n",

        "text": "## Stock Management Process\n> w/ FC 20-08-24 - Currently using Shireburn SFM + SIMS\n1. Requests come in via email, phone or website contact form, over the counter and requested a quotation\n2. Sometimes an onsite visit is required (a job sheet is created for this - not charged), other times its fixed (most times can be calculated without visit) \n3. Customer contact information included inside the quotation, and sent to the client via email or snail mail - and awaits written confirmation. Same rights for all (sales team + accounts)\n> HIGHLIGHT CONTACTS \n4. Once confirmed an account is opened (and all necessary details collected) and a start date is set (2-3 weeks lead time) and a job sheet is created. \n5. IPro Job Scheduler is used to create the job sheets (following a sync process with SIMS/SFM) - and the data is manually added via copy paste (including QuotationNo, and PONo, and line items). Each kind of job within quotation is broken into its own sheet - typically quotations are broken into smaller quotations based on the 'Callout' (ex Alarm Intruder, Intercom, etc...). The kind of 'Work' that needs to be carried out (ex. Delivery) is also noted. When multiple visits to a client are carried out, then the same call out number is used, but the letter at the end is incremented by one ( 1234-A, 1234-B, etc....) \n6. The job is then created, and considered Pending\n7. The job is then assigned to one or more of technicians (total technicians = 6) and a start date is assigned. 'Team Up' software is used for scheduling (calendar view)\n8. At this stage, the job sheet is given to the Store Keeper to assign the stock to the technician (and this is marked on the day when the stock is needed). \n9. Stock quantities (at techs, WIP, Pulled Stock) are tracked inside IPro Job.\n10. At the end of the day, the job sheet is brought back to the store keeper who allocates the stock used reported by the technician to the client so that it moves from AtTechs to WIP. The times of the job are also updated to reflect the data reported by the tech on the job sheet.\n11. At the end of each job (when marked as completed), the store keeper will carry out a reconciliation exercise to ensure stock quantities used and at technician are consistent.\n12. Jobs are invoiced with a 2 day latency to allow any teething problems to be identified and resolved prior to invoicing. \n> CONFIRM HOW TO ALLOCATE STOCK TO TECHS + TO CLIENT; TRY NOT 'REMOVE' STOCK UNTILL INVOICE OR AT LEAST PROVIDE WAY OF TRACKING UN-INVOICED STOCK.\n13. Quotation is then converted into an Invoice within SIMS, and the stock quantities and durations adjusted to reflect the data on the job sheets. \n14. The invoice number generated is then manually input into the IJob job sheet. \n15. In the invoice number field sometimes NC or UG are used to reflect No Charge, or Under Guarantee.\n16. Each technician has their own stock location. Need to be able to track to what job the stock is for as part of a report. \n17. Stock is accurate with a 24hr latency. \n\n## Stock and Job Reports\n> Each set of filters \n### Assigned Callouts\n- Displaying only items that are assigned to a tech (no grouping, primary tech only)\n\n### Assigned Callouts by Technician \n- Grouped by technician, includes secondary techs too\n- Lines may be repeated as different techs may be on the same job\n\n### Client History Report\n- Activity carried out at a client\n- Grouped by Job number\n\n### Guarantee Report\n- Date of installation \n- Date of expiration of warrantee\n\n### Invoiced Jobs \n- Includes InvoiceNo, and QuotationNo. \n\n### Pulled Stock \n- Grouped by client, what stock is reserved for who - awaiting to be assigned to a technician\n\n### Stock assigned to technician\n- Grouped by technician, what stock do they have on hand with the associated job number. \n\n### Stock items Used\nGrouped by Client, grouped by job, what stock items and how many were used and the value of work\n \n### Stock Quantities Summary\n- Number of stock WIP, At Tech, At Client, and on hand\n\n### Technician Hours\n- Grouped by date and technician, the number of hours spent per day.

PCI \n2. \n\n### Requirements\n- Setup correct Payment Terms to reflect documents sent by Kris S\n- Add 'Client Certification Deadline' to Quotation and display this value on the auto-created project.\n- Hide the Client Deadline field on project\n- Rename Send Message to Message Client, add a warning under the input box\n- Add an activity which triggers the creation of a project for a future date (ex.multiyear contracts)\n\n### PCI \n1. Create Opportunity\n2. Decide on Payment Terms\n3. Assigning Subject matter expert (optional)\n4. Create quotation, adjust details (WoO Labels to created project). \n5. Depending on customer selected, automatically populate (overwritable) field  Client Payment Grading (refer to Client Limitation flow charts). If brand new client default yellow, else evaluate Client Limitations Flow Charts.\n6. Upon reaching new stage 'QSA Approval' project automatically created (WoO Adjust title see recent mail, populate deadline field, add ghost tag)\n7. Quotation sent to client and subsequently confirmed.\n8. Sales Rep / Finance will press button \"50% Paid\", at which point:\n\t- Ghost label removed\n\t- Kevin receives notification of removal of Ghost tag\n\t- Kevin reviews Gaantt chart in Odoo for staff schedule (ask him how he does this atm)\n\t- Kevin assigns Auditor\n\t- Finance are notified that this is ready for Invoicing\n\t- Kevin modifies the default times for the project \n9. Finance issue the invoice to the client after reconciling the value\n10. Project label Ghost removed upon assigning an Auditor\n11. Correspondence regarding task/project progress will be managed via the Log Note and Send Message (renamed to Message Client)\n12. Automated notification to finance to invoice the client for any remaining balance once it hits the task \"Ready for Payment\"\n13. On the Accounts dashboard, Finance team will see all the projects that have \"Ready for Payment\" which will link to the relevant Task (which links to the project/SO). Once the payment has been received Finance press the \"Payment Complete\" button (that only they can see) to allow the auditor to finish the project (ex. send final report). \n\n## Rafal Amendments \n- 100% payment upfront, unless otherwise stated\n- If project value is over 5-7K, client likely to negotiate to 50/50 - but this should be avoided where possible \n- DISCUSS: CONFIRM PAYMENT HISTORY TAG?\n- Add FYI Activity Types\n- Scoping forms, notes, other correspondence\n- Review UOM adjustment to days/hours instead of units (and cannot be done immediately to retain backwards compatibility) \n- (INVESTIGATE) Create variants of products which are sold in future years (ex. PCI 2025 variant of PCI service)\n- Check Payment Terms defined within the LOE Settings \n- Customer Tags to be applied by finance manually merely to serve as a tool for guiding Sales.\n-  (FUTURE) Some attachments added via documents selection to Sales order (but not for now) \n- Create a RFP \n- At the Opportunity creation stage use an automatically generated title (Unique Identifier for Opportunity) - ie display internal ID\n- Each line of a sales order creates its own project \n- Naming convention for Projects \n- SO _ Client Name _ Service Line _ Year _ Sequence; ex. S0067_HyperJar_PCI_24_1\n- Add property to products (ie line items) for abridged name for automatic project creation \n- All projects should have states: Pending, In progress etc... as per Kris' SOPs\n- Ghost colours to be more dominant \n- Rename Project Manager 2 to Auditor\n- Display % completion in the project card\n- On the sales order line items \n\t- allow sales person to select one or more lines.\n\t- when one or more lines are ticked, un-disable the button \"Assign Client Deadline\". \n\t- When \"Assign Client Deadline\" is clicked, display a modal that shows a datepicker\n\t- When this value is set, populate the column on the ticked line items \"Client Deadline\" with this value. \n\t- This value needs to be used when auto-creating the project and set as the Client Deadline. \n\t- Finance and Sales should have ability to block projects. Request a list of blocking tags. \n\n### Deliverables  / TBD\nProject Templates\nDelivery dates (MoSCoW)\nTeams \nProject Blockers\nPool of Hours\nMultiyear Projects + Invoices \nDemo RFP module\nStages\n(30 days overdue?) \n \n### Stages \nProspective / Ghost\nAssigned\nNew Projects\n\n\n# case 2\nKeep track of milestones\n\n",

Could you please prepare an implementation and payment plan based on key milestones? Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could advise us on any potential additional costs related to the server and Odoo.\n\nAs discussed, we would like the project kickoff to occur between the 2nd and 4th of September, with the goal of delivering an MVP by the end of November or earlier.\n\nTo ensure a smooth process, I recommend scheduling a meeting with Rafal and Karishma at your earliest convenience, should you require their input on the implementation plan.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nKris Savona\n\n----\n\n16-09-24\n\nHi  Kris,\n\nAs  Kris  had advised, please find below my updates:\n\n1.  The expenses app that you advised to check, works only for employees and not for third-party vendors. So I would like that the vendor bills be qualified under direct and indirect expenses.\n2.  We cannot use the same email address for two persons. (referring to our conversation that I would like my team to be notified altogether when an activity is set for the finance team).\n3.  Anyone can reopen the period of a closed Financial year, I would like to set some approval status to be able to reopen it.\n4.  Prepayments/prepaid income when extracted as a report, does not show products and vendor or customer names. I would like that the products and names appear on the reports.\n5.  Set up a pop-up when opening Odoo for task deadline\n6.  Customisation of certain reports\n7.  Fixed Asset/Depreciation Schedule\n8.  How to upload the commissions excel on Odoo\n9.  You were supposed to send some tutorials for Management Accounts\n\n**Karishma Abeeluck**  \n\n----\n\n",

Create Opportunity\n2. Decide on Payment Terms\n3. Assigning Subject matter expert (optional)\n4. Create quotation, adjust details (WoO Labels to created project). \n5. Depending on customer selected, automatically populate (overwritable) field  Client Payment Grading (refer to Client Limitation flow charts). If brand new client default yellow, else evaluate Client Limitations Flow Charts.\n6. Upon reaching new stage 'QSA Approval' project automatically created (WoO Adjust title see recent mail, populate deadline field, add ghost tag)\n7. Quotation sent to client and subsequently confirmed.\n8. Sales Rep / Finance will press button \"50% Paid\", at which point:\n\t- Ghost label removed\n\t- Kevin receives notification of removal of Ghost tag\n\t- Kevin reviews Gaantt chart in Odoo for staff schedule (ask him how he does this atm)\n\t- Kevin assigns Auditor\n\t- Finance are notified that this is ready for Invoicing\n\t- Kevin modifies the default times for the project \n9. Finance issue the invoice to the client after reconciling the value\n10. Project label Ghost removed upon assigning an Auditor\n11. Correspondence regarding task/project progress will be managed via the Log Note and Send Message (renamed to Message Client)\n12. Automated notification to finance to invoice the client for any remaining balance once it hits the task \"Ready for Payment\"\n13. On the Accounts dashboard, Finance team will see all the projects that have \"Ready for Payment\" which will link to the relevant Task (which links to the project/SO). Once the payment has been received Finance press the \"Payment Complete\" button (that only they can see) to allow the auditor to finish the project (ex. send final report). \n\n## Rafal Amendments \n- 100% payment upfront, unless otherwise stated\n- If project value is over 5-7K, client likely to negotiate to 50/50 - but this should be avoided where possible \n- DISCUSS: CONFIRM PAYMENT HISTORY TAG?\n- Add FYI Activity Types\n- Scoping forms, notes, other correspondence\n- Review UOM adjustment to days/hours instead of units (and cannot be done immediately to retain backwards compatibility) \n- (INVESTIGATE) Create variants of products which are sold in future years (ex. PCI 2025 variant of PCI service)\n- Check Payment Terms defined within the LOE Settings \n- Customer Tags to be applied by finance manually merely to serve as a tool for guiding Sales.\n-  (FUTURE) Some attachments added via documents selection to Sales order (but not for now) \n- Create a RFP \n- At the Opportunity creation stage use an automatically generated title (Unique Identifier for Opportunity) - ie display internal ID\n- Each line of a sales order creates its own project \n- Naming convention for Projects \n- SO _ Client Name _ Service Line _ Year _ Sequence; ex. S0067_HyperJar_PCI_24_1\n- Add property to products (ie line items) for abridged name for automatic project creation \n- All projects should have states: Pending, In progress etc... as per Kris' SOPs\n- Ghost colours to be more dominant \n- Rename Project Manager 2 to Auditor\n- Display % completion in the project card\n- On the sales order line items \n\t- allow sales person to select one or more lines.\n\t- when one or more lines are ticked, un-disable the button \"Assign Client Deadline\". \n\t- When \"Assign Client Deadline\" is clicked, display a modal that shows a datepicker\n\t- When this value is set, populate the column on the ticked line items \"Client Deadline\" with this value. \n\t- This value needs to be used when auto-creating the project and set as the Client Deadline. \n\t- Finance and Sales should have ability to block projects. Request a list of blocking tags. \n\n### Deliverables  / TBD\nProject Templates\nDelivery dates (MoSCoW)\nTeams \nProject Blockers\nPool of Hours\nMultiyear Projects + Invoices \nDemo RFP module\nStages\n(30 days overdue?) \n \n### Stages \nProspective / Ghost\nAssigned\nNew Projects\n\n\n# case 2\nKeep track of milestones\n\n",

Requests come in via email, phone or website contact form, over the counter and requested a quotation\n2. Sometimes an onsite visit is required (a job sheet is created for this - not charged), other times its fixed (most times can be calculated without visit) \n3. Customer contact information included inside the quotation, and sent to the client via email or snail mail - and awaits written confirmation. Same rights for all (sales team + accounts)\n> HIGHLIGHT CONTACTS \n4. Once confirmed an account is opened (and all necessary details collected) and a start date is set (2-3 weeks lead time) and a job sheet is created. \n5. IPro Job Scheduler is used to create the job sheets (following a sync process with SIMS/SFM) - and the data is manually added via copy paste (including QuotationNo, and PONo, and line items). Each kind of job within quotation is broken into its own sheet - typically quotations are broken into smaller quotations based on the 'Callout' (ex Alarm Intruder, Intercom, etc...). The kind of 'Work' that needs to be carried out (ex. Delivery) is also noted. When multiple visits to a client are carried out, then the same call out number is used, but the letter at the end is incremented by one ( 1234-A, 1234-B, etc....) \n6. The job is then created, and considered Pending\n7. The job is then assigned to one or more of technicians (total technicians = 6) and a start date is assigned. 'Team Up' software is used for scheduling (calendar view)\n8. At this stage, the job sheet is given to the Store Keeper to assign the stock to the technician (and this is marked on the day when the stock is needed). \n9. Stock quantities (at techs, WIP, Pulled Stock) are tracked inside IPro Job.\n10. At the end of the day, the job sheet is brought back to the store keeper who allocates the stock used reported by the technician to the client so that it moves from AtTechs to WIP. The times of the job are also updated to reflect the data reported by the tech on the job sheet.\n11. At the end of each job (when marked as completed), the store keeper will carry out a reconciliation exercise to ensure stock quantities used and at technician are consistent.\n12. Jobs are invoiced with a 2 day latency to allow any teething problems to be identified and resolved prior to invoicing. \n> CONFIRM HOW TO ALLOCATE STOCK TO TECHS + TO CLIENT; TRY NOT 'REMOVE' STOCK UNTILL INVOICE OR AT LEAST PROVIDE WAY OF TRACKING UN-INVOICED STOCK.\n13. Quotation is then converted into an Invoice within SIMS, and the stock quantities and durations adjusted to reflect the data on the job sheets. \n14. The invoice number generated is then manually input into the IJob job sheet. \n15. In the invoice number field sometimes NC or UG are used to reflect No Charge, or Under Guarantee.\n16. Each technician has their own stock location. Need to be able to track to what job the stock is for as part of a report. \n17. Stock is accurate with a 24hr latency. \n\n## Stock and Job Reports\n> Each set of filters \n### Assigned Callouts\n- Displaying only items that are assigned to a tech (no grouping, primary tech only)\n\n### Assigned Callouts by Technician \n- Grouped by technician, includes secondary techs too\n- Lines may be repeated as different techs may be on the same job\n\n### Client History Report\n- Activity carried out at a client\n- Grouped by Job number\n\n### Guarantee Report\n- Date of installation \n- Date of expiration of warrantee\n\n### Invoiced Jobs \n- Includes InvoiceNo, and QuotationNo. \n\n### Pulled Stock \n- Grouped by client, what stock is reserved for who - awaiting to be assigned to a technician\n\n### Stock assigned to technician\n- Grouped by technician, what stock do they have on hand with the associated job number. \n\n### Stock items Used\nGrouped by Client, grouped by job, what stock items and how many were used and the value of work\n \n### Stock Quantities Summary\n- Number of stock WIP, At Tech, At Client, and on hand\n\n### Technician Hours\n- Grouped by date and technician, the number of hours spent per day.

✅ **PWA Implementation Complete**

The note-taking app is now a full Progressive Web App with offline functionality:

## Implemented Features:

### 1. Service Worker
- ✅ Caches app shell and critical assets for offline use
- ✅ Network-first strategy for API calls with cache fallback
- ✅ Cache-first strategy for static assets with background updates
- ✅ Handles offline responses gracefully
- ✅ Supports periodic background sync

### 2. Authentication & Session Persistence
- ✅ JWT token stored in localStorage persists across sessions
- ✅ User remains logged in when opening app offline
- ✅ Token auto-refresh before expiration
- ✅ Auth warnings shown when session expires (yellow toast)
- ✅ Sync button disabled when not authenticated

### 3. Offline/Online Detection
- ✅ Real-time online/offline status tracking in syncStore
- ✅ Visual offline indicator banner at top of screen
- ✅ Sync button shows "Offline" state when no connection
- ✅ Toasts notify users when connection status changes
- ✅ Auto-sync when connection is restored

### 4. PWA Installation
- ✅ Web App Manifest configured
- ✅ Install prompt component (appears after 5 seconds)
- ✅ Dismissible prompt with 7-day cooldown
- ✅ Meta tags for mobile devices
- ✅ Apple touch icon support

### 5. Sync System Improvements
- ✅ Sync disabled when offline (preserves battery)
- ✅ Sync disabled when authentication fails
- ✅ WebSocket reconnection on network restore
- ✅ Local changes queue until sync is available
- ✅ crsqlite continues to work offline with local DB

### 6. Build & Development
- ✅ Vite configured to serve service worker in dev mode
- ✅ Service worker copied to dist/ during production build
- ✅ WASM files properly cached for offline use

### 7. Production Configuration
- ✅ Nginx headers for PWA support
- ✅ Service worker cache-control headers
- ✅ WASM MIME type configuration
- ✅ CORS headers for SharedArrayBuffer

## User Experience Flow:

1. **First Visit (Online):**
   - User accesses app, service worker installs
   - App assets cached in background
   - Install prompt appears after 5 seconds
   - User can log in, sync is enabled

2. **Subsequent Visits (Offline):**
   - App loads instantly from cache
   - User session persisted (if previously logged in)
   - Offline indicator shows at top
   - Sync button disabled/shows "Offline"
   - All note editing works locally via crsqlite
   - Changes queued for sync

3. **Coming Back Online:**
   - "Back online!" success toast
   - Sync automatically triggered
   - WebSocket reconnects
   - All queued changes sync to server

4. **Session Expiration (Online):**
   - Auto-refresh attempts before expiration
   - If refresh fails, yellow warning toast shown
   - Sync disabled
   - User prompted to log in again

## Technical Details:

- **Cache Strategy:** Cache-first for app shell, network-first for API
- **Sync:** crsqlite CRDTs ensure conflict-free merging
- **Storage:** IndexedDB (via crsqlite) for notes, localStorage for tokens
- **Service Worker Scope:** Full root scope (/)
- **Update Strategy:** New SW installed in background, prompt shown

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Install app via browser prompt
- [ ] Test offline functionality (Chrome DevTools → Network → Offline)
- [ ] Verify session persists after closing/reopening app
- [ ] Test sync when coming back online
- [ ] Verify sync button disabled when offline
- [ ] Check auth expiration warning appears
- [ ] Verify WASM files load offline
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
